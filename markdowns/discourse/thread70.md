Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments
Why? 
If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?
Too many Questions for LLM 
True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer
What We need from YOU ü´µüèΩ
Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?
How?

If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a digital graphic depicting an exclamation point (!) and a question mark (?) side-by-side.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Characters:** A red exclamation point is placed to the left of a red question mark.  Both characters appear three-dimensional, with a slightly glossy or rounded look.

* **Style:** The style is simple and somewhat pixelated, suggesting a low-resolution graphic or a deliberately retro aesthetic.  The edges aren't perfectly smooth.

* **Color:** The characters are a solid, bright red against a completely black background.

* **Dots:** Below each character is a small, red dot, mirroring the shape and color of the main characters. These dots might be stylistic elements or attempts to add to the 3D effect.

* **Overall Impression:** The image conveys a sense of uncertainty or surprise, as the combination of an exclamation point and a question mark often implies a situation that is both urgent and unclear. The simplistic, almost childlike rendering contributes to the overall impression.

**Image 2**: That's a digital illustration of the popular "thinking face" emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Face:** The main focus is a round, yellow face resembling a simplified emoticon.¬†It has two small, dark circular eyes slightly tilted downwards, conveying a thoughtful or slightly skeptical expression. The eyebrows are subtly arched, adding to the pensive mood. The mouth is a thin, slightly downturned line.

* **The Hand:** A small, simplified hand is depicted touching the face near the chin.¬†The hand is yellowish-orange, matching the skin tone of the face, and has only a few simple lines indicating fingers. The gesture is classic for indicating thoughtfulness.

* **The Style:** The style is deliberately simplistic and cartoonish, reminiscent of emojis found on various digital platforms. The lines are smooth, and there's no significant shading or detail beyond the basic features. The overall color palette is warm, dominated by yellow and orange.

* **Background:** The background is a plain, slightly darker orange than the face, which creates a slight outline around the figure.  The edges are somewhat roughly cut, suggesting it might be a cropped version of a larger image.

**Image 3**: That's a close-up shot of a stylized emoticon or emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Shape and Color:** The main body is a rounded rectangle, predominantly a bright, sunny yellow-orange.  The color is vibrant and seems to have a slight gradient, perhaps a bit brighter in the center.

* **Facial Features:** The emoticon has large, round, dark brown eyes.¬†It‚Äôs wearing black, thick-rimmed glasses that sit squarely on its face.  The mouth is a wide, open grin with a bright, pinkish-red interior, showing happiness and cheerfulness.¬†

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and friendly. The features are exaggerated for comedic effect, giving it an almost playful and slightly nerdy appearance due to the glasses.  The lines are relatively smooth and not overly detailed.

* **Background:** The background is mostly black, appearing to be cropped or cut off around the emoticon's edges. This draws focus entirely to the emoji itself.

Overall, the image is simple yet expressive, clearly communicating happiness and intelligence (due to the glasses).  It's likely an image created for online use, such as in messaging apps or social media.

**Image 4**: That's a close-up shot of a stylized emoticon or emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Overall Shape and Color:** The main body is a rounded rectangle, slightly wider at the top than the bottom, resembling a simplified head or face. The predominant color is a bright, sunny yellow-orange.

* **Facial Features:** The emoji has large, round, dark brown eyes.¬†Below the eyes is a wide, open mouth with a bright pink or red inner part, suggesting a happy and joyful expression.

* **Glasses:**¬†The most distinctive feature is a pair of black, nerdy-style glasses sitting atop the eyes.¬†The glasses are simple, without much detail, but clearly defined.

* **Style:** The overall style is cartoonish and friendly. The lines are bold and slightly uneven, giving it a hand-drawn or slightly imperfect quality, rather than a perfectly smooth digital rendering.  The colors are saturated and vibrant.

* **Background:** The background is mostly black, cutting off most of the edges of the emoji, focusing attention on the face itself.


The image overall evokes a feeling of cheerfulness and intelligence, thanks to the combination of the happy expression and the glasses.

**Image 5**: That's a stylized emoticon or emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Shape:** The basic shape is a rounded rectangle, slightly wider at the top than the bottom, resembling a vertically oriented oval.  It's primarily a bright, sunny yellow-orange color.

* **Face:** The face is simple but expressive.  It has two large, round, dark brown eyes, and a wide, open mouth with a prominent, slightly upturned smile, revealing a pinkish-red tongue or inner mouth.  The overall expression is one of cheerful intelligence or knowing amusement.

* **Glasses:** The emoticon wears thick, black-rimmed glasses that sit squarely on the face, further adding to the "nerdy" or intellectual look.

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and friendly, reminiscent of emojis used in online communication or digital design. The lines are fairly smooth, and the colors are saturated and bold.

* **Background:** The background is mostly black, providing a contrast that makes the yellow emoticon stand out clearly.  There might be some subtle gradient or shadowing in the yellow, giving it a slightly three-dimensional appearance.

**Image 6**: That's a digital image of a thumbs-up gesture.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Style:** The image is cartoonish or simplistic in style. It's not photorealistic; the hand is rendered with relatively few details and smooth shading.  The lines are not sharp or highly defined.

* **Color:** The hand is a light peach or beige color.¬†The shading is subtle, suggesting a slight curve to the hand.

* **Composition:** The hand is shown from a slightly angled perspective, not perfectly head-on. The thumb is prominently displayed and extended upward. The fingers are slightly clenched.

* **Background:** The background is transparent or black, allowing the hand to be easily seen.

* **Overall:** The image is a simple, easily recognizable representation of a thumbs-up gesture, often used to convey approval or positivity.

**Image 7**: That's a digital image of a thumbs-up gesture.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Style:** The image is cartoonish or simplistic in style, not photorealistic. The lines are somewhat pixelated or blocky, suggesting a low resolution or a deliberate retro/pixel art aesthetic.

* **Color:** The hand is a light, peachy beige tone.¬†The background is entirely black, making the hand stand out clearly.

* **Shape and Form:** The hand is depicted in a fairly standard thumbs-up pose. The thumb is extended and separated from the other fingers, which are curled into a fist. The details are simplified; there's no intricate shading or detailing of the fingernails or skin texture.

* **Overall Impression:** The image is simple, positive, and easily recognizable as a thumbs-up symbol conveying approval or agreement.

**Image 8**: That's a digital image of the ‚Äúthinking face‚Äù emoji, a popular emoticon used to express contemplation or uncertainty.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Face:** The main focus is a yellow, circular face with simple, cartoonish features.  The eyebrows are slightly arched, conveying a thoughtful or slightly skeptical expression. The eyes are small, dark circles. The mouth is a thin, slightly downturned line, adding to the pensive mood.

* **The Hand:** A small yellow hand is depicted to the lower left of the face. The index finger is touching the face near the chin, a common gesture associated with thinking.¬†The hand is similarly simplistic in style, matching the cartoonish nature of the face.

* **The Style:** The overall style is reminiscent of emojis found in many digital communication platforms. The colors are flat and bright, with minimal shading or detail. The lines are clean and bold.

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, slightly darker shade of yellow/orange, providing contrast to the emoji itself.  The edges are not sharply defined, giving a slightly softer, rounded look to the image.

In short, it‚Äôs a classic representation of a thinking emoji, capturing a moment of reflection or pondering.

**Image 9**: That's a digital rendering of a stylized human face, reminiscent of pixel art or a low-resolution video game character.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Face:** The face is simplified, with large, dark brown eyes that are somewhat spaced apart.¬†The nose is implied rather than explicitly drawn, and the mouth is a small, dark oval suggesting a surprised or slightly scared expression. The skin tone is light beige or peach.

* **Hair:** The hair is light blonde or yellowish-gold and appears somewhat messy or slightly windblown, with a few strands implied rather than detailed.

* **Body:** Only the upper body is visible, depicted as a rectangular shape, suggesting a simple, blocky representation of a torso.¬†The shirt is a teal or turquoise color.

* **Style:** The overall style is very simplistic, almost primitive. The lack of detail and the blocky nature strongly suggest a low-resolution or pixelated aesthetic. The colors are flat and not shaded, contributing to the blocky appearance.

* **Possible context:**¬†The style suggests the image might be a still from a simple video game, an avatar from a low-resolution online platform, or part of a meme or internet image macro.

**Image 10**: That's a digital image of a low-resolution, pixelated character, reminiscent of early video game graphics or a simplistic avatar.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Character:** The character appears to be a male figure with light blond or yellowish hair.¬†The face is simple, with dark brown or black eyes that are somewhat large in proportion to the head, and a dark mouth forming an expression that seems surprised or slightly shocked.¬†The skin tone is light.

* **Body:** The body is a simple rectangular shape, depicted in a teal or turquoise shirt.¬†The body is not fully shown, it‚Äôs cropped at the bottom and the shoulders.  The proportions are exaggerated and unrealistic, characteristic of a low-fidelity visual style.

* **Style:** The overall style is extremely low-resolution and blocky, with large, clearly visible pixels. The colors are somewhat muted and slightly dull. There is a lack of fine details or shading.  The image suggests a 2D presentation,  fitting within pixel art or 8-bit style aesthetics.

* **Background:** There's essentially no visible background; the character is the main and only focus.  The background where the character is not visible seems to be simply black.


The overall impression is of a simple, perhaps quirky, digital avatar, possibly from a video game, online chat, or another similar digital environment.

**Image 11**: That's a close-up shot of a cartoon fist, likely a digital illustration or emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Color and Texture:** The fist is a medium brown tone, suggesting skin.¬†The color is fairly uniform, with no significant shading or highlighting to create a three-dimensional effect.  The texture appears smooth, lacking any details like wrinkles or pores.

* **Shape and Form:** The fist is depicted in a simple, slightly stylized manner. The knuckles are clearly indicated by three vertical lines, but they aren't overly detailed. The overall shape is rounded and somewhat flat, lacking the full depth and complexity of a realistic fist.¬†The thumb is partially visible, tucked against the palm.

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and simplistic. It's not photorealistic; instead, it aims for clear communication of the "fist" concept without excessive detail.  The lines are clean and relatively bold.

* **Background:** The background is completely black, making the fist stand out prominently.

The image likely represents a gesture of defiance, strength, or solidarity, common interpretations associated with a clenched fist.

This time I‚Äôll create a functioning script way before deadline for everyone to use .

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Close-up view of the Jolly Roger, the pirate flag of the Straw Hat Pirates from the anime series One Piece.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Flag:** The flag is black with a prominent white skull wearing a straw hat. The skull has a cheerful, almost cartoonish expression, with wide, round eyes and a toothy grin.¬†Two crossbones are positioned behind the skull's head. The style is simplistic yet iconic.

* **The Hat:** The straw hat is a bright, yellowish-orange and is a key visual element of the Straw Hat Pirates' identity.

* **The Mast:** A portion of a wooden ship's mast is visible in the left side of the image, suggesting the flag is flying from a ship.

* **The Background:** The background is a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds, creating a contrast with the dark flag.

* **Animation Style:** The image clearly shows the distinct animation style of One Piece, with its characteristic clean lines and slightly exaggerated features.

The overall impression is one of vibrant color, dynamic movement (the flag seems to be billowing in the wind), and a playful yet powerful representation of a pirate crew.

**Image 1**: (Error: 451 Client Error:  for url: https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/48.png)

**Image 2**: That's a close-up shot of a digital graphic depicting a red "X" symbol against a black background.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The "X":** The "X" is formed by two thick, slightly rounded lines that intersect in the center. The lines aren't perfectly straight; they have a gentle curve, giving them a slightly softer look than a sharp, geometric "X". The color is a vibrant, slightly glossy red.¬†There's a subtle shading effect, suggesting a three-dimensional quality, with a highlight at the edges and a darker tone in the center of each line.

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, deep black, providing a stark contrast to the bright red "X," making it highly visible.

* **Overall Style:** The style is simple, almost cartoonish. It's reminiscent of icons commonly found in video games, user interfaces, or simple graphic design.  The pixelation is subtle but noticeable, hinting that it might be a low-resolution or raster graphic.

**Image 3**: That's a digital image of a checkmark icon.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Shape:** The icon is square with slightly rounded corners, giving it a button-like appearance.

* **Color:** The background of the square is a light, pastel green.

* **Checkmark:** A large, white checkmark is prominently displayed in the center. The checkmark is hand-drawn or has a deliberately informal, slightly uneven style, not perfectly geometric.

* **Style:** The overall style is simple, cartoonish, and friendly.  It suggests a user interface element, perhaps for indicating completion or agreement.  The slightly glossy look adds to the button-like effect.
