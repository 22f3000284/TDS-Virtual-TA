### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a multiple-choice question from a computer science exam or quiz.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Header:** The top section contains metadata about the question, including the question number (307), question ID (6406531045319), question type (MCQ - Multiple Choice Question), and the points awarded for a correct answer (1).

* **Question:** The question asks which of the provided methods is the best way to determine if a log entry's timestamp falls on a Saturday.Â It specifies that the `timestamp` object is a method from Python's `datetime` library.

* **Options:** Four options (A, B, C, D) are presented, each showing a line of Python code.  Each option uses a different method to check the day of the week.  A green checkmark indicates the correct answer (option B: `Check if timestamp.weekday() == 6`).  Red X marks indicate the incorrect options.

* **Option A:** `Check if timestamp.weekday() == 5`

* **Option B (Correct):** `Check if timestamp.weekday() == 6`

* **Option C:** `Check if timestamp.strftime('%A') == 'Saturday'`

* **Option D:** `Check if timestamp.dayname() == 'Saturday'`


The overall appearance suggests a digital screenshot from an online learning platform or testing system. The font is a standard sans-serif font. The background is white, and the text is clearly visible with clear demarcation between the question, options, and metadata.
