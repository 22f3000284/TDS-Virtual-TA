Hello Sir,
I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.
Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.
Thanks and Regards
Shalini

Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in timeâ€¦

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.
ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.
Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.
The problem is the lack of time.
So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.
Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.
Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.
The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.
Kind regards

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.
Kind regards

3 questions:-

will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a stylized image of Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist of the anime and manga series *One Piece*.Â 


Here's a description:

* **Luffy's Depiction:** The image shows Luffy from the chest up. He's wearing his iconic straw hat. His expression is somewhat obscured, but it seems to convey a mix of happiness or excitement and perhaps a little bit of shyness or nervousness.  His eyes are partially visible, and his mouth is slightly open. His hand is raised in a wave or a gesture of greeting.

* **Style:** The art style is cute and slightly chibi-like, meaning the character is drawn with exaggerated proportions, particularly a larger head relative to the body. The lines are soft and not overly detailed.

* **Color Palette:** The background is a pale, warm orange or peach color. Luffy's hat is a brighter, more saturated yellow-gold, contrasting nicely against the background. His hair is a dark brown.

* **Overall Impression:** The image is cheerful and conveys a sense of youthful energy. It's likely fanart or a stylized representation of Luffy, not a direct screenshot from the anime or manga.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up image of stylized anime-style artwork featuring what appears to be Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist from the popular manga and anime series *One Piece*.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Luffy's Depiction:** The image focuses on Luffy's head and shoulders. He's depicted in a slightly chibi-like style, meaning his proportions are exaggerated, with a larger head relative to his body. His signature straw hat is prominent, a bright yellowish-orange.Â His eyes are partially closed, and he appears to be waving or gesturing with his raised right hand. His expression is somewhat endearing and perhaps a little mischievous or playful. His hair is brown.

* **Style and Coloring:** The art style is soft and slightly rounded. The colors are generally muted and warm, with the background a pale peach or orange. The overall effect is cute and friendly.

* **Image Quality:** The image appears to be of relatively low resolution; the details aren't sharply defined.

* **Composition:** The image is vertically oriented, with a significant amount of empty space above Luffy's head. This draws the viewer's attention directly to the character.


In short, it's a charming, simplified piece of fan art likely inspired by *One Piece*.

**Image 3**: That's a close-up shot of stylized artwork featuring what appears to be a character inspired by Monkey D. Luffy from the anime "One Piece."Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Character:** The character is depicted from the chest up, wearing a straw hat similar to Luffy's iconic one.Â The hat is yellow/gold. The character's hair is brown and somewhat messy, peeking out from under the hat. Their expression seems to be one of slight distress or worry, with their eyes partially closed. One arm is raised in a gesture that could be interpreted as a wave or a plea.Â The style is cute and somewhat chibi-like (exaggerated features for a more adorable look).

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, pale orange-peach color, which is quite simple and uncluttered, keeping the focus on the character.

* **The Style:** The art style is soft and slightly rounded, with less sharp lines and details than a more realistic depiction. The coloring is gentle and the overall feel is whimsical.

In short, it's a charming, simplified representation of a Luffy-esque character, likely fan art, emphasizing a particular emotional moment.

Hi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.

carlton:

No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session.


yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,
also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.Â 


Here's a description based on the image:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with tan skin. He has dark hair that is short and neatly styled. He's wearing glasses with dark frames. His expression is neutral, perhaps slightly smiling, and he looks directly at the camera.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a purple collared shirt, which appears to be a polo shirt or a similar style.

* **Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-tan color, which is quite unblemished and draws all attention to the subject.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low-resolution; it's a bit blurry and lacks sharp detail.  This could be due to the original image quality or compression.


The overall impression is a simple, straightforward headshot, likely for a profile picture or similar purpose.
