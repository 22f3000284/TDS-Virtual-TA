### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a text-based email or report detailing the results of a Project 1 prerequisite check.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Greeting:** The email begins with "Dear Learner,".

* **Project Requirements:** It outlines five pre-requisites for Project 1, all related to having a properly configured GitHub repository and Docker image.  These include the existence of a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file (MIT license), a Dockerfile, and a public Docker image that uses the same Dockerfile and runs correctly.  There's a link to more details on a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page".

* **Evaluation Results:** The core of the email is the evaluation of these five requirements.  Each point is checked and marked as either "PASS" or "FAIL".  In this case, only the presence of the MIT license in the GitHub repository failed, indicating a failure overall.

* **Summary:** The final section summarizes the results, showing "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0".

* **Overall Tone:** The tone is formal and informative, clearly communicating the outcome of the automated checks and the consequences of failing to meet the minimum requirements.

The appearance is plain text, likely from an automated system, without any formatting beyond basic line breaks. There is a slight yellow highlight used around the phrase "TDS Project 1: Evaluation".

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as Licenese.md but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a GitHub Docs page detailing how to add a license to a repository.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A standard web browser address bar displays a GitHub Docs URL related to adding licenses. The browser's minimize, maximize, and close buttons are visible, along with other standard browser controls.¬†A "Search GitHub" button is in the upper right.

* **GitHub Docs Header:** The header clearly shows "GitHub Docs" and a dropdown menu for selecting a version (Free, Pro, & Team).

* **Navigation:** Below the header, a breadcrumb trail navigates through the documentation sections: "Building communities," "Healthy contributions," and "Add a license to a repo."

* **Main Content:** The bulk of the image shows instructions with numbered steps, accompanied by screenshots of the GitHub interface.  These steps guide the user through the process of creating a LICENSE file (or LICENSE.md) in their repository and choosing a suitable license template. The screenshots include file explorers, text entry fields, and buttons like "Choose a license template," "Edit," and "Preview."¬†The file name ‚Äúocto-repo‚Äù is displayed in the screenshot showing the path for the license file.

* **Side Panel (Right):** A small side panel on the right contains a section labeled "In this article," with links to "Including an open source license" and "Further reading," implying more detailed information is available elsewhere within the documentation.

* **Overall Style:** The page follows GitHub's dark theme, with a clean, minimalist design using dark gray, light gray, and white text.¬†The numbered steps are clear and easy to follow.

The image clearly illustrates a tutorial or guide for a common task within the GitHub workflow.

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

I submitted the project within the deadline, and I ensured that all requirements were fulfilled, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.
However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed ‚Äî resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I‚Äôve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.
Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I‚Äôve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.
Thank you for your understanding.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a version control system's commit history, likely from a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Commits Grouped by Date:** The commits are grouped by date (April 3rd, 2025, February 17th, 2025, and February 15th, 2025).  Each date group is visually separated by a thin horizontal line.

* **Commit Details:** Each individual commit shows:
    * **A short descriptive message:**  This explains the changes made in that specific commit (e.g., "Rename License.md to LICENSE.md").
    * **Author:**  The username "virajpitale" is consistently shown as the author of all commits.
    * **Date/Time:**  The date and time (or time elapsed since the commit) when the change was made.
    * **Verification Status:** A green "Verified" label appears next to most of the commits, indicating successful verification or testing.
    * **Commit Hash:** A unique identifier for the commit (e.g., "d62d2ee", "7624000").¬†This is a shortened version of a longer alphanumeric hash.
    * **Icons:** Small icons, likely indicating file changes or other actions associated with the commit.
* **Dark Theme:** The screenshot uses a dark theme, with light-colored text on a dark background. This improves readability in low-light environments.


The overall impression is a clean and organized view of a project's recent history within a version control system.  The consistent use of "virajpitale" suggests that a single individual made all the recorded changes.
