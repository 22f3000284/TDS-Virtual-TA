Good Morning Sir,
This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)
I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the provided image:

The image shows an email message, likely an automated assessment report for a student's project.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Salutation:** The email begins with "Dear Learner," indicating it's addressed to a student.

* **Project Requirements:** It outlines five pre-requisite checks required for Project 1. These checks cover the existence and accessibility of a GitHub repository, the presence of a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile in the repository, the public accessibility of a Docker image, and the consistency of the Dockerfile used in the image and the repository.  There's a link to a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" for more details.

* **Evaluation Results:** The email then presents the results of the prerequisite evaluations:
    * **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS
    * **Is Github repo present AND public:** FAIL
    * **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** FAIL
    * **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL

* **Consequences:** The email clearly states that failure to meet these minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.

* **Overall Impression:** The email is formal and informative, indicating an automated system checking a student's project setup before proceeding with assessment. The majority of the checks failed, suggesting the student needs to correct their project submission.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a detailed email, seemingly an evaluation report for a Project 1 Docker image submission.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Heading:** The email starts with "Dear Learner," indicating it's addressed to a student or participant.

* **Evaluation Summary:** The main body explains the evaluation process of the submitted Docker image. It mentions that missing files will result in a score of 0 and outlines the specifications for the image's responsiveness (5 minutes). The evaluation environment is detailed (8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit, 1 Gigabit network bandwidth).

* **Attached Files:** The email lists seven files included in the evaluation:
    * Evaluation log file (performance report)
    * Docker log file (technical performance)
    * Server start log file
    * Evaluation script file
    * Data generation file
    * Docker orchestration file
    * Solution script (sample)

* **Docker Image ID:** The email provides the ID of the evaluated Docker image: 4829914866b

* **Scores and Feedback:** The email clarifies that the scores provided are not final, allowing for bug reports and discrepancies until Tuesday.  They'll use the top scores (including a sample script) to normalize the rest.

* **Call to Action:** The email encourages the recipient to post concerns on a discourse thread.

* **Overall:** The email's tone is formal and informative. It clearly explains the evaluation process, the results, and the next steps for feedback and score adjustments.  The presence of URLs suggests the evaluation took place on a cloud-based platform.

Apologies for that,
The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.
Kind regards

Hi @carlton,
Iâ€™m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:
First Evaluation Email1511Ã—724 76.2 KB
Second Evaluation Email1247Ã—681 37.5 KB
My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:
GitHub repo
Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and assistance!

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows an email, seemingly an automated grading report for a project submission.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** The email's subject line clearly indicates a project grading: "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores". The sender's information includes "22t1 se2002" and an email address. The recipient is implied as "to me". The date and time of the email are also visible.

* **Salutation:** A formal salutation begins with "Dear Learner,".

* **Evaluation Summary:** The body of the email explains that a docker image submission has been evaluated. It highlights that missing files will result in a score of 0. The email notes that the docker image needed to become responsive within 5 minutes of launch and that the evaluation was run on a high-performance Google Cloud compute unit.

* **File Listings:** A numbered list provides links to several log files and other relevant files from a Google Drive, containing detailed information about the evaluation process (evaluation logs, docker logs, server start logs, evaluation scripts, data generation files, docker orchestration files, and a solution script).  Each file is briefly described.


* **Docker Image ID:** The email includes the ID of the evaluated docker image: "b0d89eee9b17".

* **Final Score Disclaimer:** The email clearly states that the provided scores are not final and that students have until Tuesday to report any issues or discrepancies. It offers to address any concerns and adjust scores accordingly.


* **Overall:** The email's tone is formal and informative, providing clear feedback about a technical project submission. The structure is logical and well-organized, making the information readily accessible to the recipient. The use of hyperlinks makes accessing the files convenient.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows an email from an automated grading system for a project, likely in a computer science course.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** The email subject clearly states "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores".  The sender's email address is visible, including the student's ID ("se2002"). The timestamp indicates the email was sent a few days prior.

* **Greeting:** A formal salutation, "Dear Learner," begins the message.

* **Project Requirements:** The email details five prerequisites required to pass Project 1.Â These prerequisites relate to setting up a GitHub repository with a Dockerfile and making the resulting Docker image publicly accessible.

* **Evaluation Results:** The core of the email presents the evaluation results for each prerequisite.Â The student passed only one: their Docker image being present and public on Docker Hub.Â They failed the other four:Â the GitHub repository not being public, the missing Dockerfile, and the absence of an MIT license.

* **Overall Score:** The bottom of the email summarizes the results, stating "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0," indicating the student's submission wasn't evaluated due to the failed prerequisites.

* **Link:**  There's a hyperlink to a "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page," presumably containing more detailed explanations of the requirements.


In short, the email is an automated report detailing the failure of a student's project submission due to not meeting the minimum prerequisites. The email's format is clean and straightforward, typical of automated grading systems.

Hi,
Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a man's head and shoulders.Â 


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with tan skin. He has dark brown or black hair that is short and neatly styled. He's wearing glasses with dark frames. His expression is pleasant and neutral, almost hinting at a slight smile.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a purple collared shirt. The shirt appears to be a polo shirt or a similar style with short sleeves.

* **Background:** The background is a plain, pale yellow or beige color, providing a simple, uncluttered backdrop that focuses attention on the man.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low resolution; it's a bit blurry and the details aren't extremely sharp.  This suggests it might be a smaller version of a larger image or a photo taken with a lower-quality camera.

The overall impression is a simple, straightforward headshot of a man.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a terminal window displaying a log of a Docker build process.Â 


Here's a breakdown of what we see:

* **Docker Build Log:** The majority of the image shows a detailed output from a Docker build. This includes numerous lines starting with `=>` indicating steps in the process, like extracting layers, exporting manifests, and copying files.Â Each line shows a SHA256 hash, indicating the unique identifier of the files or layers being processed.  The times next to each line indicate how long each step took.

* **Build Progress:**Â The log shows a sequential process, indicated by numbered steps (`[2/5]`, `[3/5]`, etc.), suggesting five stages in the build. The final stages involve naming and unpacking the Docker image to a specific repository.

* **Build Command (bottom):** Near the bottom, a command is visible, indicating that the build likely involves running a Docker image (`docker run`) with environment variables (`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN`) and port mapping (`-p 8000:8000`). The image is specified by its SHA256 hash.

* **Application Startup:** The very bottom section shows information messages (`INFO:`) related to the application starting up, confirming that a server process has started and the application is running on a specific port.  A message instructing the user to press CTRL+C to quit is present.

* **File Sizes:**Â The first few lines show sizes for files or layers being handled, in MB (Megabytes).

* **Overall:** The image clearly displays the steps and progress of a Docker build process, from extracting layers to running the final application within the container. The technical details (SHA256 hashes, file sizes, times) are clearly visible.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a terminal window displaying a detailed log of a Docker build process.Â 


Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **Docker Build Log:** The majority of the image shows a lengthy output from a Docker build command. This output includes numerous lines starting with `=>` indicating various steps in the build process, such as extracting files, copying directories, running pip commands, exporting layers and manifests, and unpacking to a Docker image. Each line also shows a SHA256 hash, suggesting the process involves verifying the integrity of files.  Timings are shown next to each step, indicating how long each part of the process took.

* **Build Details Link:** Below the main build log, there's a line indicating where to find more detailed build information:  `View build details: docker-desktop://dashboard/build/desktop-linux/desktop-linux/4btzhep5n0ttsar3bibf4z96c`. This suggests a GUI interface for viewing Docker builds.

* **Docker Run Command:**Â Further down, there's a command line showing the execution of a `docker run` command.  This command specifies environment variables (`-e`), port mapping (`-p`), and a Docker image to run.  The image name is long and includes a SHA256 hash.

* **Application Startup Messages:**  At the very bottom of the terminal output, there are informational messages indicating the server process started, the application is waiting to start, application startup is complete, and finally, that the Uvicorn server is running on a specified port (`http://0.0.0.0:8000`).

* **Overall:** The image provides a complete record of a Docker build process, from initial steps of transferring context to the final message confirming that the application is running successfully. The numerous SHA256 hashes suggest a focus on security and integrity. The presence of the `docker-desktop` URL implies that the build is managed through the Docker Desktop application.

    Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repoâ€™s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
