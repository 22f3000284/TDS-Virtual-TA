Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top:** The repository name "ritwiktrivedi/ROE-Master-Snippets-File" is prominently displayed in a dark grey font against a white background.

* **Top Right:** A headshot of a man with dark hair, glasses, and a beard is shown in a square image. He's wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The background of the headshot is a dark greyish-blue.

I am too sleepy to work on it nowâ€¦ So seriouslyâ€¦ PRs are not only appreciated but needed. Just add the basic parsing code or image manipulation for ga5. I will try and add in the morning but who doesnâ€™t like Good PRs? Also mentioning @23f2005325 (Aishik) here for his wonderful PR which I have now merged.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a source control graphical user interface (GUI), likely from a version control system like Git.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visual elements:

* **Top Bar:** A dark gray bar at the top displays "SOURCE CONTROL GR..." (truncated), an Auto button, and several other icons that suggest common version control actions (like branching, merging, refreshing).

* **Main Section:** The majority of the image shows a log of recent commits or changes.  Each commit is represented by a colored dot on a vertical line, followed by a brief description of the commit. The descriptions include merge pull requests, file additions, renaming actions, and other typical version control operations.Â  Commit messages are truncated with "...", suggesting there is more text beyond what's shown.

* **Branch Indication:** The `main` branch is clearly indicated next to one of the merge commits.Â 

* **Commit Colors:** Each commit has a colored dot to its left, with colors suggesting different types of actions, or possibly denoting different developers or branches.

The overall style is dark and clean, common in many modern developer tools. The font is monospace, suitable for code and text-based logs. The image highlights recent activity in a source code repository.

**Image 2**: That's a digital image of a red heart.Â 


Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:

* **Shape and Color:** The heart is a classic, slightly rounded heart shape, not perfectly symmetrical. It's a bright, slightly glossy red, with a subtle highlight near the top suggesting a light source.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish.  The edges are not perfectly smooth; there's a slightly pixelated or low-resolution quality to it, giving it a retro or simplified look.  This isn't photorealistic; it's clearly a digital drawing or graphic.

* **Background:** The background is completely black, making the red heart stand out prominently.

The overall impression is a cute, simple, and easily recognizable heart icon, likely used for expressing affection or positivity in digital contexts.

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
