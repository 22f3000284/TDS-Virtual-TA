Please post any questions related to Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent.
Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM
Update on 27 Jan 2025:
A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip ¬∑ sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public ¬∑ GitHub
You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.
Please note:

This is a sample. It WILL change.
Don‚Äôt rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change.
LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:

Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations


Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
For those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

Hi Shouvik,
We will have live sessions to guide on how to do project.
Kind regards

sir @Jivraj after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those  required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of text, likely from a code editor or terminal, providing instructions.¬†


Here's a breakdown:

* **Header:** "A1. Install uv (if required) and run" This indicates a numbered step (A1) in a set of instructions, suggesting the user needs to install a software component ("uv") and then execute a command.

* **URL:** A long URL is prominently displayed: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`. This is a link to a Python script (`datagen.py`) hosted on GitHub.

* **Instructions:** The text below the URL indicates that the script should be run with a specific argument: `with ${user.email}`.  The `${user.email}` suggests that the user's email address should be substituted as input.

* **Note:** A parenthetical note clarifies that running the script will generate data files necessary for subsequent tasks.

The overall appearance suggests a step-by-step guide, possibly part of a larger tutorial or assignment, involving data generation and analysis. The dark background and light text are typical of many code editors and terminal interfaces.

Hi Guddu ,
I didn‚Äôt make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?
command that I used :
uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data
here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.
Kind regards
Jivraj

Hi Aishik,
Pls add context to your query, without that we won‚Äôt be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.



 23f2005325:

openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}



Possible reasons for this issue:

Not using anand sir‚Äôs proxy url for sending requests.
Token not being correct.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a simple graphic: a capital letter "A" in white, set against a solid Kelly green background.¬†


The "A" is sans-serif, meaning it lacks the small decorative strokes at the ends of its lines. It's centered within the frame and appears to be relatively large in proportion to the background. The green is a fairly uniform, even tone. There are no shadows or other visual effects on the letter itself.  The image is simple and straightforward.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase ‚Äúrecent log file‚Äù, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log- file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:
Deliverables,
and an example of the Evaluation has been provided.
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.
Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764√ó1764 374 KB
Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.
So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.
Kind regards

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a document outlining the deliverables and evaluation criteria for a software development task.¬†


**Deliverables Section:** This section lists a series of steps to complete, including:

* Creating a GitHub repository and adding an MIT license.
* Writing and testing code using POST and GET requests to interact with a specific API endpoint.
* Creating a Dockerfile to build and publish a Docker image to Docker Hub.
* Using environment variables (specifically AIPROXY_TOKEN) to securely handle API keys without committing them to the repository.
* Submitting the GitHub and Docker image URLs via a Google Form.


**Note Section:** This provides important clarifications:

* Emphasizes the importance of using environment variables for the API token, stressing not to commit it directly to the repository.
* Explains the $1 limit of the AI Proxy token and instructs users to contact the TDS team if they need more tokens.
* Specifies the use of the GPT-40-Mini model and warns about the 20-second time limit for API calls.


**Evaluation Section:** This section is mentioned but lacks details; it's implied that there will be a separate evaluation process, likely after submitting the deliverables.


**Overall Style:**¬†The document is clearly structured using bullet points and headings, making it easy to read and understand. The use of code snippets (e.g., `POST /run?task=...`, `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]`) helps illustrate the technical aspects. The color scheme is simple, using mostly black text on a white background, with red accents for headings and potentially section separators.

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.
