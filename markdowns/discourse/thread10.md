Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero. Should I refill the answers for all the questions before saving again? Could this issue also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?

Hi Shalini,
We are aware of the issue and @s.anand is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.
The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.
Kind regards

Hello,
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?

    @23f2005067 @23f2003751 I added a ‚ÄúRecent saves‚Äù feature. 
This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

Do remember to click the ‚ÄúCheck‚Äù button to calculate your score. That is not automatic. 
Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a man, seemingly a portrait.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Subject:** The man appears to be middle-aged, with light to medium skin tone. His hair is short and light brown or graying, receding slightly at the temples. He's wearing glasses, though the frames aren't clearly visible. His expression is somewhat serious or pensive; his mouth is slightly open.¬†There are subtle shadows on his face, particularly around his eyes and nose, suggesting a specific lighting setup.  He's dressed in what looks like a dark-colored, possibly brown or gray, collared shirt or jacket.

* **The Lighting:** The lighting is dramatic, with a strong light source seemingly coming from above and to the side, creating highlights and deep shadows on his face. This chiaroscuro effect adds depth and dimension to the portrait. The background is a blurry, indistinct, dark reddish-brown tone.

* **The Quality:** The image quality is not exceptionally sharp; it has a slightly soft or blurred focus, particularly noticeable in the background and the finer details of his clothing and hair. This might be due to the age of the image or the photographic technique used. The overall color palette is muted and warm.

The overall impression is that of a somewhat formal or artistic portrait, possibly from a painting or a photograph with stylistic choices to enhance the mood and character of the subject.
