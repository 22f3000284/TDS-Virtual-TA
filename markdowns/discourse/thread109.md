Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?
This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a text excerpt, likely from a student handbook or similar document, detailing the policy on repeating courses for improvement.Â 


The text is neatly formatted, with clear paragraphing and a title: "12.5.3 Repeating a Course for Improvement."Â 


Key points from the text include:

* **Eligibility:** Repeating a course is allowed for grades A, B, C, D, or E.
* **Grade Recording:** The highest grade achieved will be recorded.
* **Course Limit:** The total number of courses must remain within the CCC limit (meaning of CCC is not explained).
* **Fees:** Repeating a course costs double the normal fee.
* **Registration:**  Improvement courses can be registered at any level, even higher levels than the original course.
* **Recommendation:** Learners are advised to progress with new courses instead of repeating unless absolutely necessary.
* **Course Materials:** Completed course materials remain available to students.

The overall tone is informative and slightly cautionary, suggesting that repeating courses should be a last resort. The font appears to be a standard, sans-serif typeface commonly used in printed documents.

TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.
Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement. If you have passed it, its better to move on.

Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective).
So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.

This is not up to us. We make adjustments within assignments and projects and we have done that already. For course level bonuses, that is the discretion of operations.
