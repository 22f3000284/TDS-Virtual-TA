Sir,
I havenâ€™t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi @Sakshi6479,
You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.
That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.
Kind regards

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image contains a text block against a light sage green background.Â 


The text is in a sans-serif font and is formatted as follows:

* **Headline:** "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse" in a slightly larger, bold font.

* **Body Text:**  The following paragraph explains the bonus marks system. It specifies that IITM BS students who reply to a particular discussion thread ("GA4-Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]") with a relevant question or reply will receive one bonus mark on their graded assignment.

The overall style is clean and straightforward, typical of instructions or announcements found in an online course or learning management system. The color scheme is muted and professional.
