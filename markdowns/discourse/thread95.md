Sir I thought that the ‚ÄòLICENSE‚Äô file had to be renamed to ‚ÄòMIT LICENSE‚Äô.
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a Git repository's interface, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Repository Information:** At the top, it displays the repository name "tds_project-1" labeled as "Public." Standard repository controls like "Pin" and "Unwatch" are also present.

* **Branch and Tag Information:** Below, it shows the current branch ("main"), the number of branches (1), and the number of tags (0).

* **File Navigation and Commit History:** The main section lists the files and directories within the repository.¬†Each file/directory is shown with an icon indicating its type (folder, file). Alongside each item is a brief description of the associated commit (e.g., "Final Submission", "First submission", "Create LICENSE", "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE").  A timestamp ("2 months ago" or "now") indicates when the change was made.  A commit hash ("c61a6ef") is shown, indicating the most recent commit. The number of commits is also shown (6).

* **Search and File Addition:**  There's a search bar ("Go to file") and an option to add files to the repository.

The overall style is dark-themed, typical of many code-hosting platforms. The information displayed clearly indicates the structure and recent activity of a software project's repository.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a text-based output, likely from an automated grading or evaluation system for a software project.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Warning:** The top line warns that failure to meet minimum requirements will prevent evaluation of the submission.

* **Project Evaluations:** The next section displays a list of prerequisite checks for Project 1. Each check assesses a specific aspect of the submission, such as:
    * The presence of a Docker image in Docker Hub and whether it's public.
    * The presence of a GitHub repository and whether it's public.
    * The presence of a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    * The presence of an MIT license in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

* **Results:** Each check is marked as either "PASS" or "FAIL".¬†In this specific case, three checks passed and one failed (the MIT license check).

* **Summary:**¬†The final section summarizes the overall results.  Because one prerequisite failed, the "Prerequisites" are marked as "FAIL", and the "Project 1 Score" is 0.

The overall appearance is plain text, likely from a command line interface or a simple web page, lacking any decorative elements. The font is a standard sans-serif type. The text is aligned to the left.

Hi @22f3000585
Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).
Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs
Kind regards

Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‚ÄòMIT LICENSE‚Äô.
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of text, likely from an automated email or system message.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Line:** It starts with the phrase "We see that your submission" followed by a hyperlink to a GitHub repository: `https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git`. The sentence concludes with "...has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:". This indicates a failed submission to a system that checks for certain criteria.

* **Bottom Line:** This line lists the reasons for the failure, separated by semicolons:

    * "No such repo" - The repository linked does not exist.
    * "No "MIT" in LICENSE" - The repository lacks a license file, or the license file does not contain the MIT license.
    * "No Dockerfile" -¬†The repository is missing a Dockerfile, which is used to build and run Docker containers.

The text is simple, using straightforward language common in automated feedback. The highlighted words (No, MIT, No) might be highlighted in a different color in the original, possibly yellow or orange, to draw attention to the failure points.

Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of text, likely from an email or automated message related to a submission process, possibly for an academic assignment or competition.¬†


The text is divided into three parts:

1. **A heading:** "No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile" This indicates a requirement not met in the submission.  "MIT" likely refers to a license type (MIT License), and the absence of a Dockerfile is also flagged as a problem.

2. **An instruction:** "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring." This explicitly states that the submission needs to meet certain criteria (presumably detailed in the "above checklist," which isn't shown) to be evaluated.

3. **A note:** "Note: We've only considered your latest submissions, as we permitted students to submit more than once." This clarifies the scoring process, indicating that multiple submissions were allowed but only the most recent one was used for evaluation. The word "latest" is underlined, possibly for emphasis.


The font is plain and simple, and the text is left-aligned. The overall tone is formal and informative. The lack of visual elements beyond the text suggests a plain-text email or a similar format.

@24ds2000125 @22f3000585
I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.
But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.
These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These ‚Äúminor‚Äù things matter.
Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.
We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.
I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.
Kindest regards

Sir,
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‚ÄòLICENSE‚Äô to ‚ÄòMIT LICENSE‚Äô on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.
Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image contains a text-based output, likely from a script or automated check, detailing a pre-requisites check.¬†


The output is organized as follows:

* **Header:** "Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)" clearly indicates the purpose of the output ‚Äì to show the success or failure of different checks.  The scoring system (1 for pass, 0 for fail) is explicitly stated.

* **Individual Checks:** Each line below the header represents a specific check:
    * "Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1" - This check passed (indicated by '1').
    * "Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1" -  This check also passed.
    * "Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 0" - This check failed (indicated by '0').
    * "Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1" - This check passed. Note a minor typo in "Github" in this line.

The checks appear to verify the existence and public accessibility of a Docker repository and a GitHub repository, along with the presence of specific files (LICENSE or LICENSE.md and Dockerfile) within the GitHub repository.  The timestamp constraint suggests that the repositories must have been created or updated before February 18th.

The overall presentation is simple and clear, designed to quickly communicate the results of a series of automated tests.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of text, likely from an automated system providing feedback on a code submission.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the text:

* **First Line:** "We see that your submission https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:" This line indicates a failed code submission to a system, likely a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.  The URL points to a GitHub repository.

* **Second Line:** "No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE No Dockerfile" This line explains the reasons for failure.  It means:
    * The repository linked in the submission URL was not found.
    * No MIT license was found in the project's LICENSE file.
    * A Dockerfile was also missing.


The overall impression is that a project submission failed automated checks due to missing files (repository, license, and Dockerfile), leading to a "FAIL" status. The style is plain text, possibly from a log file or email.

**Image 3**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a Git repository's commit history, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.¬†


Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **Top Bar:** Shows a repository identifier (22f3000585), the commit message ("Create LICENSE"), the author's commit hash ("c61a6ef"), the time since the last commit ("5 days ago"), and the total number of commits ("6 Commits").

* **Body:** The main part displays a list of files and folders changed in the commits. Each entry includes:

    * **File/Folder Icon:** A visual indicator of whether the item is a file (document icon) or a folder (folder icon).
    * **File/Folder Name:**  Names of files and folders within the repository (e.g., `_pycache_`, `venv`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `MIT LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `test.txt`).
    * **Commit Message:** A brief description of the changes made in each commit (e.g., "Final Submission," "First submission," "Create LICENSE," "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE").
    * **Time Since Commit:**  Indicates when each commit was made (e.g., "2 months ago," "5 days ago").


* **Overall Style:** The screenshot has a dark theme, common in developer tools. The information is clearly organized in a tabular format, making it easy to read.

In essence, the image provides a concise overview of recent activity and file changes within a specific Git repository.
