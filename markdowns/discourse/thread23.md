Hello,
I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a webpage, likely from an online learning platform or assessment tool.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Red Bar:** A red banner at the very top displays "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST," indicating the completion time of something. A small, unidentifiable icon is in the top right corner.

* **Light Blue Box:** Below the red banner is a light blue box with a speech bubble icon and the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse," suggesting a forum or community for questions.

* **Login Information:**Â The next section shows the user's login status: "You are logged in as 22ds1000103@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."  A "Logout" button is also present.

* **Recent Saves Section:** A light green box displays "Recent saves." Below it are three entries, each showing a "Reload" button, a timestamp (date and time), and a score. This indicates recent work or attempts.  The dates and times suggest multiple attempts on consecutive days.

* **Overall Appearance:** The webpage is clean and simple, with a consistent color scheme (red, light blue, and light green) to separate sections.  The interface is likely user-friendly and straightforward.

The overall impression is that the screenshot comes from a platform used for online quizzes, assignments, or similar educational tasks.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of an online graded assignment interface.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Heading:** The top clearly states "Graded Assignment 1".

* **Due Date Notice:** A prominent message indicates that the due date for the assignment has passed, specifying the date and time (2025-01-26, 23:59 IST). It also mentions that multiple submissions are allowed before the deadline.

* **Troubleshooting Section:**  A section provides troubleshooting tips for students experiencing access problems.Â These include disabling ad blockers, enabling cookies, ensuring Javascript is enabled, recommending Chrome browser, disabling browser extensions, and checking for overly aggressive antivirus software.

* **Student ID Requirement:** A crucial instruction emphasizes the need to use the student's specific ID (with an example format provided) to access the assignment. It warns that failure to do so will result in the submission not being considered.

* **Question and Answer:** A single multiple-choice question asks if the student has viewed the assignment through a provided link. The student answered "No," resulting in an incorrect answer and a score of 0.

* **Accepted Answer:**Â The correct answer is shown at the bottom as "Yes".

* **Point Value:** The question is worth 1 point.

The overall appearance suggests a simple, functional online assessment platform. The design is clean and uncluttered, focusing on conveying information and instructions clearly.

@Muthupalaniappan
It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.
You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.
Kind regards

Dear Sir,
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.Â 


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with tan skin. He has dark hair that is short and neatly styled. He's wearing rectangular, dark-framed glasses. His expression is pleasant and somewhat reserved; he has a subtle smile.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a purple collared shirt, which seems to be made of a relatively smooth material.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, pale yellowish-beige color, providing a simple and uncluttered setting that focuses attention on the man.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is not exceptionally sharp; it appears slightly pixelated or compressed, suggesting it might be a low-resolution photo or a digital scan of a printed image.  The colors are slightly muted.

Hello,
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9,  so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Respected Sir,
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?
Thanks

@23f2005471
Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Respected Sir/Madam,
I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment
and if you wonâ€™t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

Dear @s.anand sir,
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??
I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.
I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

The image shows a screen capture of a multiple choice question and its results.Â 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Question:** The question asks if the user has seen and attempted a graded assignment available at a specific link.

Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Header:** A red banner at the top indicates the assignment's end time: "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". A small, almost invisible close button is in the top right corner.

* **Instructions:** Below the header, numbered instructions are given, emphasizing that the student can use any resources (Internet, ChatGPT, etc.) and that "hacking" the code is allowed.

* **Recommendation:** A section follows with advice on whether to take TDS (likely a course) based on the time taken to complete the assignment and the score achieved.

* **Discourse Link:** A teal-colored box with a speech bubble icon invites users to join a discussion on Discourse, a platform for online forums.

* **Login Status:** The screen shows the user is logged in, displaying a portion of their email address: "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".  A "Logout" button is provided.

* **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves" shows three entries, each indicating a "Reload" action with the same timestamp ("1/26/2025, 11:59:45 PM") and a score of 9.5. This implies the user has saved their progress multiple times.


The overall style is clean and minimalist, with dark backgrounds and light-colored text for good contrast. The color palette is primarily dark teal, gray, and red. The design suggests a modern, possibly educational online platform.

@Jivraj @carlton I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen capture, likely from an online learning platform or grading system.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Section:** This area displays a dark-green box containing three lines of text, each showing a "Reload" button followed by a timestamp and a score.  These timestamps all appear to be from January 26th, 2025, at various times. The scores are 9, 8.5, and 8. This suggests multiple attempts at the assignment.

* **Middle Section:** Below the top section, there's a section with a "image" button (suggesting the ability to upload an image), followed by percentage indicators (100%, 75%, 50%) and a trash can icon. A student's plea is written below it, explaining that they attempted the assignment, saved their score, but forgot to confirm their submission.

* **Submission Section:** There is a statement about needing to use a student ID for the graded assignment, followed by a multiple-choice question: "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." Two radio buttons are shown for 'Yes' and 'No', with the 'No' option selected (and a message indicating the answer is incorrect and a score of 0).

* **Bottom Section:** Finally, a "Accepted Answers:" label is displayed followed by a single line that says "Yes".  This suggests the correct answer to the question.

The overall impression is that a student is seeking help to have their assignment graded, despite a procedural oversight on their part. The image implies a system for graded assignments with multiple attempts and a requirement to formally submit the work.

The topics cover various aspects of coding, including using specific tools (VS Code, npx, Google Sheets, etc.), file manipulation, data formats (JSON, CSV), and using version control (GitHub).Â 

* **Overall:** The overall design is simple and functional, typical of an online learning platform or assessment tool. The font is clean and easy to read. The color scheme is muted and professional.

Hi Mandy,
Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A top bar displays a URL fragment, suggesting a web-based coding environment.  The URL includes "exam.sanand.workers.dev," indicating a possible testing or assessment platform.

* **Assignment Details:** The main section shows an assignment's due date (Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST), a perfect score (10/10), a "Check" button (likely for submitting code), and a "Save" button.

* **Coding Problem:** The core of the screenshot shows a SQL query problem. The user is instructed to write a query to retrieve rows where the "Type" column is "Gold," handling variations in capitalization and extra spaces.Â The example given is `FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`. This query uses the `LOWER` and `TRIM` functions to ensure case-insensitive matching and removal of extra spaces.

* **Instructions:** Clear instructions specify that the query should ignore spaces and treat misspellings like "GOLD," "gold," etc., as "Gold".Â It also asks to calculate sales.

* **Status:** The status indicates the submission has been "Submitted."Â A message warns that resubmitting will overwrite the previous submission. A note also encourages regular saving.

* **Overall:** The screenshot's appearance suggests a structured online coding assessment or assignment platform, possibly for a course or educational setting. The color scheme is dark, with green accents used for success indicators.

Wrong GA1 score on my dashboard

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a student's online learning management system (LMS) dashboard.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** Shows "IIT Madras" (likely the institution's name) and "Jan 2025 - TDS" (possibly the term or session). There are also small icons in the upper right corner that suggest notifications, messages, and a user profile.

* **Left Sidebar:** A navigation menu with two clearly visible sections: "Modules" (represented by a document icon) and "Grades" (represented by a gradebook icon).  Other options might exist, but are not visible.

* **Main Content Area:** This is the largest part of the screen and displays information about a specific module and assignment.

    * **Module Title:** "Module 1: Development Tools"
    * **Assignment:** "Graded Assignment 1"Â with a status of "Submitted".Â 
    * **Due Date:** Clearly shows the assignment was due on January 26th, 2025.
    * **Scores:** The student received a perfect score of 100. Peer average is 99%, and the median score is also 100. There are hyperlinks labeled "View Chart" next to both the student's score and the peer average, suggesting charts showing score distributions are available.


* **Overall Style:** The design is clean and minimalist with a predominantly white background and light gray accents. The color scheme is muted and professional.


The overall impression is that the screenshot shows a student who successfully completed an assignment in an online course. The display of peer averages and median scores suggests a focus on providing students with comparative performance data.
