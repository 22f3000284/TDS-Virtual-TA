### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a smiling emoticon, specifically a variation of the classic smiley face emoji.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Face:** The emoji is a bright, almost saturated yellow circle representing the face.Â The eyes are simple, small, black curved lines that suggest a contented, almost mischievous smile.

* **The Smile:** The mouth is a wide, toothy grin. The teeth are depicted as a series of small, white, rectangular shapes, neatly aligned in a row.  This is what distinguishes this emoji from many standard smiley faces, which often have simpler, less detailed mouth designs.

* **The Background:** A small portion of an orange background is visible to the left of the emoji.  It is slightly darker than the yellow of the face.

* **Overall:** The overall impression is one of extreme happiness, bordering on mischievousness or silliness, due to the exaggeratedly wide grin.  The image is digitally rendered, characteristic of emojis used in digital communication.

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

@carlton will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?

@carlton
I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web page displayed on a Windows computer screen.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** A standard browser window toolbar is visible at the very top, showing tabs for multiple websites including Google Drive and a Colab notebook. The address bar displays "study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html".

* **Website Header:** Below the browser's toolbar, the website's header contains the IIT Madras logo on the left, followed by the text "IIT Madras". A navigation menu with options like "Academics," "Admissions," "Resources," "Student Life," "School Connect," "Achievements," "Events," "FAQ," "About IITM," "Partnerships," "Placements," and a "Sign In" button are present.

* **Announcement Banner:** A red banner reads "Applications Open now for May 2025 Batch | Applications Close: May 20, 2025 | Exam: July 13, 2025" with an "APPLY NOW" button.

* **Exam Schedule Table:** A prominent table displays the schedule for exams on March 2nd, 2025.Â It lists three courses: "Python A1," "Python A2," and "Java," showing their respective timings and exam links. The links appear to point to specific exam pages on the IIT Madras website.

* **Footer:** A small section at the bottom of the table mentions "Important Links for OPPE".

* **Taskbar:** The Windows taskbar is visible at the very bottom of the screen, displaying various application icons and the time/date.

The overall appearance suggests an official website for IIT Madras, providing information about online exams and their schedules. The screenshot shows a clean, well-organized layout, using clear headings and a simple color scheme.
