@carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.
Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Google Sheets access request screen.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the elements:

* **Top:** The Google Sheets logo is displayed prominently at the top left, followed by the text "Google Sheets".

* **Center:** The main message "You need access" is displayed in a large, bold font. Below this, a smaller text explains that the user can either request access or switch to an account that already has access. A link to "Learn more" is provided. A text box is available for the user to enter an optional message.  A button labeled "Request access" is below the message box.

* **Graphic:** A simple, illustrated graphic is shown to the right. It depicts a person walking through a doorway that resembles a Google Sheet icon.  This is a visual metaphor for gaining access.

* **Bottom:** At the very bottom, it displays the currently signed-in email address: "22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a person icon to its left. This confirms to the user which account is making the request.

The overall style is clean and minimalist, typical of Google's design language. The color scheme is light and airy, with shades of blue, green, and white.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a close-up view of a digital text, specifically instructions or tasks listed in a simple, clear format.Â 


The text is primarily black on a white background. The text is neatly formatted with numbered points.

The instructions are:

1.  **Create a Google Sheet:** Create a new, blank Google Sheet workbook and name it according to a specific pattern:  "ga.7.1.rollno," replacing "rollno" with the user's IITM roll number (without the domain).
2.  **Share the Sheet:** Share the newly created Google Sheet with editing rights to a specific email address: se2002@study.iitm.ac.in.  A critical note is added that failure to complete this step first will result in the submission not being considered.


The overall style is straightforward and informative, likely part of an assignment or instructions for a submission.
