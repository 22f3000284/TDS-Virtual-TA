### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely a course website or learning management system (LMS).Â 


The screen is divided into two main sections:

* **Left-hand Side:** This section contains a sidebar menu with a search bar at the top.  The search bar says "Type to search." Below it is a hierarchical menu structure, starting with "Tools in Data Science" as the main heading.Â This heading is expandable, revealing subheadings like "Development Tools," "Deployment Tools," "Large Language Models," "Data Sourcing," "Data Preparation," "Data Analysis," and "Data Visualization."  Each subheading can likely be expanded to reveal more detailed information.

* **Right-hand Side:** This section displays the main content of the page. The content is organized into sections:

    * **Teaching Assistants:** This section provides contact information (email and potentially a Twitter handle) for teaching assistants along with instructions on how to use a virtual GPT assistant.

    * **Course Links:** This section contains links to various course-related resources.  

    * **Jan 2025 Links:** This section contains a list of specific links to materials for January 2025.  The links include a grading document, course page, course calendar, announcement group, course material, and TA session links.

The overall design is clean and modern, using a dark background (dark gray or black) with light text for better contrast and readability. The design is consistent with many modern online learning platforms.Â The image shows that a menu is selected, and a secondary menu is expanded further down.
