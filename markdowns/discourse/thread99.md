‚ÄúStudents are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.‚Äù
So I did. 

 Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments 
Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.
But let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶
It was my Labrador who did the actual work 
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn‚Äôt even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.
He growled at broken APIs.
I took the credit. 

 Message from the Dog Developer:

‚ÄúThank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.
But I am personally offended by one thing‚Ä¶‚Äù


‚ÄúHow dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?
I skipped it ‚Äî just like many ‚Äî because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.
I demand justice. And a belly rub.‚Äù
‚Äì , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist


 Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework.
You get the grade. They get the rage.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital illustration of a person, seemingly a simplified emoji or avatar, rendered in a low-resolution, blocky style reminiscent of early video games or pixel art.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Character:** The figure is humanoid, with a simplistic design. It has a yellow face with simple, dark brown eyes, a small, curved mouth suggesting a smile, and short brown hair. The body is represented by a teal or turquoise shirt.¬†The arms are relatively blocky, with one arm extended to the side.

* **Style:** The style is deliberately low-resolution, utilizing large, square pixels to construct the image.¬†There's a lack of fine detail; features are basic and geometric. The color palette is limited, using only a few solid colors.

* **Background:** The background is entirely black, providing a stark contrast that makes the character pop.

The overall impression is a playful, informal representation of a person, likely used in a digital context such as messaging or online communication. The low resolution adds to the informal and friendly feel.

**Image 2**: That's a digital image of a cartoon dog's head.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Style:** The style is simple and pixelated, reminiscent of emojis or simple digital art.  The colors are flat and not shaded, giving it a childlike or icon-like quality.

* **Features:** The dog has a light tan or cream-colored face. Its ears are a medium brown, and it has a single brown patch over its right eye (from the viewer's perspective).¬†The eyes are simple black dots.  It has a small black nose and a pink tongue sticking out.  The overall expression is happy and friendly.

* **Background:** The background is transparent; only the dog's head is visible.

The image is small and low resolution, emphasizing its simplistic design.

**Image 3**: That's a simple, low-resolution digital illustration of a graduation cap (mortarboard).¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** The cap is a dark gray or black, square-shaped with a flat top and a slightly angled, downward-sloping brim.¬†The overall shape is somewhat blocky, indicating a low pixel count or simple rendering style.

* **Tassle:** A yellow tassel hangs from the cap's top center, extending down to the bottom left.¬†The tassel is simple, with no intricate details.

* **Style:** The image is highly stylized and lacks realistic detail. It looks like it could be a basic icon or symbol used in digital interfaces, rather than a photorealistic representation.  The edges are not smooth but rather pixelated or blocky.

* **Background:** The background is transparent; this allows the image to be easily used on various backgrounds without a distracting color behind the graduation cap.

**Image 4**: That's an icon or graphic depicting a stack of books.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Shape and Arrangement:** The books are stacked slightly askew, not perfectly aligned, giving a casual, informal look. The top book is the largest, and the books decrease slightly in size as they go down.

* **Colors:** The books are in different solid colors:¬†red (top), dark grey/black, light green, and blue (bottom).  The spines are a slightly darker shade of the book's main color.

* **Style:** The style is simple, cartoonish, and somewhat pixelated, suggesting it might be from a website, app, or a simple graphic design. The edges are not sharply defined; they are slightly softened.

* **Perspective:** The perspective is isometric, meaning it's a three-dimensional representation with a slightly tilted view.


Overall, it's a clear and easily understandable image representing a collection of books.

**Image 5**: That's a pixel art image of a light blue laptop computer.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Overall Style:** The image is clearly in a pixel art style, meaning it's composed of distinct squares of color, rather than smooth gradients or curves.  The resolution is low, contributing to the blocky appearance.

* **Color:** The laptop is predominantly a light, pastel blue. The screen is a slightly darker shade of blue-gray.¬†

* **Shape and Details:** The laptop is depicted in a simple, frontal view.¬†The keyboard is represented by a solid block of color, without individual keys being shown.  The screen is a rectangular block taking up most of the laptop's area. There is no visible indication of a power button, ports, or other details.

* **Background:** The background is entirely black, making the light blue laptop stand out clearly.

The image is simple and clean, suitable for use as an icon or a basic representation of a laptop in a low-resolution context.

**Image 6**: That's a pixel art image of a German Shepherd dog wearing a service dog harness.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Dog:** The dog is depicted in a simplified, pixelated style. It's primarily tan with darker brown markings on its back and legs, characteristic of a German Shepherd. The ears are pointed, and the overall form is recognizable as a canine. The details are limited by the pixel art style, lacking fine details like individual hairs.

* **The Harness:** The dog wears a harness that's mostly red or salmon-colored with black straps. This indicates it's likely a service or working dog. A bright light blue, almost glowing, element extends from the top of the harness, possibly representing a light or some type of assistive device.

* **The Style:** The image is clearly pixel art; the shapes are blocky, and the colors are flat and limited. The resolution is low, contributing to the retro or game-like aesthetic. The background is transparent, making the dog the clear focus.

In short, it's a simple, easily identifiable image of a service German Shepherd rendered in a pixel art style.

**Image 7**: That's a pixel art image of a brain.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Style:** The image is clearly pixel art, meaning it's composed of individual squares of color, giving it a low-resolution, slightly blocky appearance.  The style is reminiscent of older video games or internet graphics.

* **Color:** The brain is primarily a light pinkish-red color. The color is fairly uniform, although there's a slightly darker shade used to indicate the folds and crevices of the brain's surface.

* **Shape and Detail:** The image depicts a brain in profile view (from the side). The characteristic folds and convolutions of the cerebral cortex are visible, albeit simplified due to the pixel art style. The cerebellum (the smaller part at the base of the brain) is also shown, albeit less detailed.

* **Background:** The background is transparent or black, allowing the brain image to stand out clearly.


The overall impression is a simple, cartoonish representation of a brain, suitable for use as an icon or in a low-resolution context.

**Image 8**: That's a pixel art emoji depicting a hand having its nails painted.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Hand:** The hand is simplified, with a roughly oval, yellowish-orange palm and three fingers clearly visible. The fingers are chunky and somewhat stubby, typical of pixel art.¬†The nails are a bright, slightly desaturated red.

* **The Nail Polish:** A dark gray nail polish bottle is shown applying polish to one of the nails. The brush is a thin, dark line extending from the bottle.

* **Style:** The overall style is low-resolution pixel art, meaning the image is composed of clearly visible, square pixels.¬†The colors are bold and slightly cartoonish.  The black background makes the emoji stand out clearly.


The image is concise and directly conveys the action of painting nails.

**Image 9**: That's a digital illustration of a megaphone, likely a simplified cartoon or icon style.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its appearance:

* **Shape and Color:** The megaphone is angled slightly to the right.¬†The body is primarily white, with a red section at the handle and extending partially up the side. The horn (the large, sound-projecting end) is mostly dark teal or blue-green, with a lighter area near the center suggesting a throat or opening for sound.

* **Style:** The image uses a low resolution or pixelated style; the edges are not smooth and appear slightly jagged. The colors are flat and lack shading or gradients, contributing to the simplistic, icon-like look.  The overall look is reminiscent of a design found in simple mobile apps or video games.

* **Details:** There's a small, dark gray detail suggesting a grip or connection between the handle and the body of the megaphone.  The details are minimal, focusing on conveying the shape and function of the megaphone rather than photorealistic representation.

**Image 10**: That's a digital image of a cartoon puppy's face.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Size:** The image is square or nearly square, showing only the head and upper neck of the puppy.

* **Color Palette:** The overall color scheme is warm and friendly. The puppy's main body color is a light beige or cream.¬†Its ears are a medium brown, and it has a rusty-orange patch over its right eye.¬†The tongue is a bright pink.

* **Features:** The puppy has large, round, dark eyes; a small, dark nose; and a small, pink tongue sticking out.¬†The ears are floppy and rounded.  The style is simplistic, reminiscent of emojis or simple vector art.  The features are not highly detailed.

* **Style:** The style is very simple and cartoonish, lacking fine details or shading.  The lines are clean and bold. The overall feel is playful and cute.

* **Background:** The background is transparent.

**Image 11**: That's a simple digital image showing two blue paw prints against a black background.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Paw Prints:** Two stylized paw prints are depicted. They are not realistic; rather, they are somewhat blocky and pixelated, suggesting a low-resolution graphic. Each paw print has four toes, which are rounded and simple shapes.

* **Color:** The paw prints are a solid, medium-blue color. The background is a solid black.  There's a clear contrast between the blue and black.

* **Style:** The overall style is very basic and cartoonish. It looks like a simple icon or symbol that might be used in a logo, website, or app related to pets or animals.

* **Size and Placement:** The two paw prints are roughly the same size and are positioned slightly apart from each other, one above the other.  They aren't perfectly aligned.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep ‚Äî and that‚Äôs how I ended up missing GA7. Please don‚Äôt hurt him any further.
