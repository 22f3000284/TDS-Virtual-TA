There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

Do not submit or save your answers.
All the best!
Kind regards

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.
We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).
Kind regards,
TDS Team

Update 1

IMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.
The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.
We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.
We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.
All the best!

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a small, circular version of the Google logo.¬†


Here's a description:

* **The Logo:** It shows the familiar Google "G" logo, where the letter is formed using four colored segments: red, yellow, green, and blue. The colors are slightly muted in this small version.

* **The Circle:** The "G" sits within a white circle, which is possibly slightly off-white or has a very subtle texture, making it appear slightly less pure white due to the low resolution.  The circle provides a background and frame for the logo.

* **Resolution:** The image is low-resolution, resulting in a slightly pixelated or blurry appearance.  The colors are not sharply defined.

* **Overall:** The image is a compact, simplified representation of the iconic Google logo.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image is a promotional shot for Google Workspace, showcasing its features through a clean and modern interface.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visual elements:

* **Central Focus:** The main focus is a Google Calendar-like view with a daily schedule, showing appointments like "Team Meeting," "Follow Up," and "Finalize Presentation."¬†The calendar integrates a video conferencing aspect, with a small video window displaying a person in a video call, labeled ‚ÄúTeam Meeting‚Äù with a "Join with Google Meet" button.  The video call includes the avatars of three attendees. The calendar view also shows a personal calendar entry (‚ÄúLunch with Lucy‚Äù).  There's also a ‚ÄúSubmit Reimbursements‚Äù entry and an ‚ÄúOrder Stationery‚Äù entry, implying expense tracking.

* **Supplementary Elements:**¬†Surrounding the main calendar area are other Google Workspace tools, such as a monthly calendar view, and a simple task list showing a "Follow up" item marked as "Yes".

* **Overall Design:** The aesthetic is minimalist, using a primarily white background with accents of Google's signature blue and green colors. The various elements are clearly organized and easy to understand.¬†

* **Branding:** The Google Workspace logo is prominently placed at the bottom right, reinforcing the brand identity.

The image effectively communicates the integrated nature of Google Workspace's tools‚Äîcalendar, video conferencing, task management, and expense tracking‚Äîshowing how they work together in a seamless workflow.

After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.

@23f2003413
We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.
It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

The chaos of ROE.
The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly
Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction ‚Üí Data Cleaning ‚Üí Data Transformation ‚Üí Data Analyisis ‚Üí Information to answer questions
The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.
Today‚Äôs Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).
I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.
Kind regards

Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was "SRI GOBINDPUR"
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957
using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR
  

      drive.google.com
  

  
      



df_gobindpur.csv

Google Drive file.

  

  
    
    
  

  


then i used margin formula as
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

using this i got answer for 1st question as
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

shubhamatkal:

df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]



For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software



 shubhamatkal:

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64


That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.
Kind regards.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a simple image.¬†


It shows a capital letter "S" in a sans-serif font. The "S" is white and centered on a solid blue background. The blue is a fairly deep, rich blue.¬†The image is likely a logo, icon, or avatar.

**Image 2**: That's a simple image!¬†


It's a square, solid blue background with a single, large, sans-serif capital letter "S" in the center. The "S" is white or very light-colored, creating a high contrast against the blue. The letter appears to be in a standard, plain typeface, without any embellishments or stylistic variations.  The "S" is centered both horizontally and vertically within the square.

@Jivraj @carlton
‚ÄúSATHUPALLE‚Äù and ‚ÄúNILANGA‚Äù were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn‚Äôt find any data for these.  Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is ‚ÄúSattenapalle‚Äù, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?
