In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)
Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0
I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there
I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didnâ€™t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a web page from a course management system, likely used for online learning.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Navigation Bar:** A standard browser's top bar is visible, showing the URL, typical browser controls (back, forward, refresh), and various tabs, including "What's New," "My Dashboard," "Graded Assignment," "Important Update," "Support Ticketing," and "Submit a Ticket."Â 

* **Course Navigation (Left Side):**Â A sidebar on the left contains a navigation menu, listing modules of a course. The modules include "Module 2: Deployment Tools," "Module 3: Large Language Models," "Project 1," "Module 4: Data Sourcing," "Module 5: Data Preparation," "Graded Assignment 5," and "Learning Feedback." The "Graded Assignment 5" item is highlighted, suggesting the user's current focus. The sidebar also shows "Modules" and "Grades" sections.  A small calculator icon is also visible.

* **Main Content Area (Right Side):** The main part of the screen shows information about a "Graded Assignment 5." The content includes:
    * **Due Date:** Clearly displays the due date and time.
    * **Submission Instructions:** States that multiple submissions are allowed before the deadline, with only the final submission graded.
    * **Troubleshooting:** Provides instructions on how to resolve potential access issues. These instructions focus on disabling ad blockers, ensuring cookies are enabled, using the Chrome browser, and temporarily disabling browser extensions or overly aggressive antivirus software.
    * **Student ID Requirement:** Explicitly states that the student's ID must be used to access the assignment.
    * **Assignment Link:** A direct link to access the graded assignment is provided.

* **Institution Branding:**Â At the top left, there's a logo suggesting the course is affiliated with IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras). The date "Jan 2025-TDS" is also present, possibly indicating the course's term and year.


The overall appearance suggests a professional online learning platform, providing clear instructions and troubleshooting information for students working on a graded assignment. The color scheme is primarily white and light gray, with accents of blue and darker gray used for navigation and highlighting.

@22f3001561 GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).
All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.
We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.
Kind regards
