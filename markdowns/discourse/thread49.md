Is this something to worry about?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying an online quiz or assessment titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation".Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Browser Window:** The screenshot shows a Chrome-like browser window with tabs and standard controls (back/forward buttons, address bar, etc.). The URL shows a custom domain related to a quiz/exam.

* **Quiz Interface:** The main content area displays instructions for the quiz.Â These instructions explicitly allow checking answers multiple times, saving progress frequently, and using any available resources, including online tools and even hacking the code.

* **Instructions:** The instructions are numbered and clearly explain the rules and possibilities for attempting the quiz.

* **Buttons:** Buttons like "Check," "Save," and "Check all" are prominently displayed, along with a link to a "Discourse" forum for questions. A "Logout" button is also visible.

* **Progress/Score:** The score (0 in this case) is displayed in the top right corner, implying an ongoing quiz.

* **Recent Saves:** A section displays the user's recent saved attempts and scores, highlighting their most recent score as the official one.

* **User Information:** The bottom shows the user's logged-in status with a unique identifier.

* **Overall:** The design is dark-themed, making the text easy to read. The instructions suggest a flexible and open approach to completing the quiz, emphasizing learning and exploration over strict adherence to conventional exam rules.

The screenshot suggests that this is a technical assessment possibly related to data preparation within a course named "TDS 2025". The flexible nature of the assessment indicates it's designed more for learning and practical skill assessment than for traditional testing.

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.
Kind regards
