### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital rendering of a small, simple white flag.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its appearance:

* **Flag:** The flag itself is a solid, bright white, rectangular shape with slightly irregular edges, suggesting it's waving in a breeze. The waviness is depicted through pixelated, uneven lines, indicative of a low-resolution image.

* **Pole:** A light grey or silver pole supports the flag.¬†The pole is thin and relatively short in proportion to the flag.  It's also pixelated, matching the low-resolution style of the flag.

* **Style:** The overall style is simplistic and pixel-art-like, lacking fine detail and smooth lines. The colors are basic and lack shading or texture.


The image is likely a small icon or symbol, rather than a detailed illustration.

Can some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?

From the graded assignment we can‚Äôt understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.

Apart from what @CKPIITM observed about this course, here‚Äôs my first impression of this course‚Ä¶Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway‚Ä¶
The week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective.  It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard.  The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point.  What‚Äôs the context and the motivation?  Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text.  Can‚Äôt decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.  Neither does give me much understanding anyway.  It was filled with terminology that I‚Äôm yet to pick up.  The speaker didn‚Äôt apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.
Summary.  I feel the course is offered too early.  Rather, I took it a little too early.
Definitely, I can‚Äôt relate to most things the speaker is talking about.  At least, I don‚Äôt see how and where the ideas will gel with our program.  I‚Äôm sure it does, but now, I don‚Äôt know how.
Sorry, I‚Äôd never been as critical about anything as this one.  I just had to.  I‚Äôm willing to hear different opinions.
I‚Äôm awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.

I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don‚Äôt just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.
Hopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.

I feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don‚Äôt know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.
But I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only ‚Äúcomprehension‚Äù type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.

As of now, I‚Äôm set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week.  Will continue after all other ML courses are done‚Ä¶

Some sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts.
In the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.

Adding to the discussion here, I‚Äôd also have to say it‚Äôs quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it‚Äôs some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.

Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.
The other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.

I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.

As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don‚Äôt have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.

well, my choice of dropping might be wrong‚Ä¶but, guided by the following factors.


The recording was perhaps done much earlier as @CKPIITM pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would‚Äôve been already recorded.  So, lesser chances to re-record them.


There are no live sessions planned yet for this course‚Ä¶ the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it‚Äôs a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.


Finally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.

Imagine if your reason doesn‚Äôt get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don‚Äôt think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man against a solid blue background.¬†


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with dark hair styled upward and slightly spiked. He has a goatee and mustache, and his expression is pleasant, almost smiling. His skin tone is medium brown. He's wearing a dark-colored, possibly black, collared shirt.

* **The Background:** The background is a uniform, bright blue, typical of a passport photo or identification picture.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is not high resolution; it's somewhat grainy and the details are not sharply defined. It looks like it might be a scan of a printed photograph.

The overall impression is that of a standard, possibly official, portrait photograph.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up shot of a grinning emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Emoji Design:** The emoji is a classic yellow circle representing a face. It has simple, slightly curved black lines for eyes that are closed in a happy squint.¬†The mouth is a wide, toothy grin with a significant number of individual teeth depicted, giving it a slightly exaggerated and comical appearance.  The teeth are white, and some appear slightly uneven or irregular.

* **Color and Style:** The emoji uses bright, solid colors. The face is a vibrant yellow, the eyes and mouth are black and white respectively, resulting in a clear contrast. The style is simple and cartoonish.

* **Background:** A small portion of an orange background is visible to the left and slightly behind the emoji, giving the impression that the emoji is set against a larger orange area or rectangle.  Most of the image is dominated by the emoji itself.

The overall impression is one of cheerful, almost mischievous happiness.

**Image 3**: That's an emoji!¬†


It's a stylized yellow circle representing a face, with two small, dark oval eyes positioned centrally.¬†The most striking feature is a zipper depicted across the mouth area, suggesting silence or secrecy. The zipper is dark gray or black and has a series of small, evenly spaced teeth. A small, dark gray or black pull-tab is visible at the end of the zipper. The overall style is simple and reminiscent of common emoji designs.  The background is mostly black, except for some minor pixelation around the edges of the emoji.

But this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn.  I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a smiling emoticon, reminiscent of a common emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Face:** The emoticon is a bright, cheerful yellow circle.¬†It has two small, dark circles for eyes, positioned relatively close together.¬†The mouth is a wide, open smile with a noticeable, slightly pink tongue sticking out. The smile line is quite pronounced, suggesting a joyful expression.

* **The Style:** The style is simplistic and cartoonish, typical of emojis used in digital communication. The lines are not highly detailed, giving it a smooth, almost slightly glossy look.

* **The Background:** The background is a slightly less saturated, but still warm, yellowish-orange color, providing a complementary backdrop to the emoticon.¬†A small portion of the background is visible around the edges of the yellow face.

The overall impression is one of happiness and lightheartedness. The image is clearly designed for digital use and communication.

I certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread.
In my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.

I also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital image of a simple smiley emoticon.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a round, bright yellow circle.  The yellow is a fairly saturated, cheerful shade.

* **Facial Features:** The emoticon has two small, dark circles for eyes, positioned relatively close together.¬†Below the eyes is a simple, slightly curved line representing a mouth, indicating a pleasant or content expression. The mouth doesn't have a wide, exaggerated upward curve, suggesting a more subtle, understated happiness.

* **Style:** The style is minimalist and straightforward, characteristic of basic emoticons found across various digital platforms. The edges are slightly pixelated, suggesting it's a low-resolution image.¬†The lack of detail makes the emotion easily recognizable despite its simplicity.

* **Background:** The background is transparent or black, allowing the yellow circle to stand out clearly.
