On 2nd March, I have both Java OPPE and TDS ROE.
My Java OPPE timing is: 9:30 to 11:00 AM
MY TDS ROE timing is: 10:30 to 11:15 AM
A minimum gap of one hour is recommended.
I have written to support.
@carlton Please look into this.

I guess roe time is 13:00 to 13:45 and it is same for all , also check calender for the same.

@Nelson
TDS ROE is at 1pm in the afternoon for everyone.

Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zones—Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3). On the same day, I intended to delete my post on Discourse but couldn’t find it, as it was still in draft mode. So, I deleted it. However, I was surprised to see the post today.
I regret any inconvenience caused.
