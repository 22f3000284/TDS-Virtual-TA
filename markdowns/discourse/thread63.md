Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi
First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.
However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.
Key Challenges Faced
 Lack of Prerequisites
This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students‚Äîincluding those from non-technical backgrounds‚Äîto enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.
 Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure
The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.
 Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback
Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition‚Äîespecially for working professionals and students without prior experience.
 Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)
While we have put in significant effort‚Äîspending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores‚Äîwe still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.
We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.
We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.
Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital image of a single, stylized, light-blue diamond shape set against a completely black background.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:

* **Shape:** The diamond is not a perfect geometric diamond; it has slightly softened, rounded corners, giving it a less sharp, more organic feel.

* **Color:** The color is a pastel or light blue, appearing somewhat glossy or reflective.  It's not a vibrant, intense blue, but rather a muted, calm shade.

* **Texture:** The image suggests a smooth, possibly slightly shiny or glassy texture, although this is an interpretation based on the lighting and color rendering.

* **Lighting:** There's a subtle suggestion of light reflecting off the top of the diamond, enhancing its three-dimensionality.

* **Background:** The background is pure, uniform black, providing maximum contrast to the blue diamond and making it the clear focal point.

The overall impression is a simple, clean, and somewhat playful graphic element.

**Image 2**: That's a digital image of a single, stylized, blue diamond.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its characteristics:

* **Shape:** It's a diamond shape, but not a perfectly geometric one. The edges are slightly softened and not sharp, giving it a more rounded, almost pillow-like appearance.

* **Color:** The diamond is a medium-to-light blue.  The color appears somewhat glossy or reflective.

* **Texture:** It looks smooth and somewhat shiny, suggestive of a polished gem or a smooth, painted surface.

* **Background:** The background is pure black, making the blue diamond stand out prominently.

* **Lighting:** The lighting seems to be subtly highlighting the top and center of the diamond, suggesting a light source from above.

The overall impression is a simple, clean, and somewhat whimsical graphic representation of a blue diamond.  It could be used as an icon, a game element, or part of a larger design.

**Image 3**: That's a close-up shot of a small, light-blue, diamond-shaped object.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Shape and Color:** The object is distinctly diamond-shaped, with slightly rounded edges. Its color is a pale, almost pastel blue.  The blue appears slightly glossy or reflective, suggesting a smooth surface.

* **Background:** The background is entirely black, providing a stark contrast that makes the blue object stand out clearly.

* **Lighting:** The lighting is subtle; there aren't any harsh shadows, suggesting a soft, diffused light source.  The slight shine on the object implies a light source is present, but its exact location is not discernible.

* **Texture:** The image suggests a smooth, possibly plastic or glass-like, texture.

The overall impression is that of a small, simple, and brightly colored object against a dark backdrop.  It could be a button, a jewel-like decoration, or a piece from a game.

**Image 4**: That's a close-up shot of a small, stylized, blue diamond-shaped object.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Shape and Color:** The object is predominantly diamond-shaped, although the corners are slightly softened, not perfectly sharp. The color is a medium-to-light blue, appearing somewhat glossy or reflective.

* **Texture and Lighting:** The surface seems smooth and slightly shiny, suggesting a polished or glassy texture. The lighting is subtle, with no harsh shadows, giving it a relatively even illumination.

* **Background:** The background is pure black, providing a stark contrast that makes the blue object stand out clearly.

* **Overall Impression:** The image is simple and clean, focusing attention entirely on the small, blue, diamond-like shape. It could be a digital rendering, a graphic element, or a close-up of a small physical object.

Right,
I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.
I tried to attempt today‚Äôs mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.
I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That‚Äôs was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.

Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Could you please look into the above issue?
Additionally, I‚Äôd like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:
Grading Concerns
Final Course Score:
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)
From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù by students:
What‚Äôs the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.
Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.
Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues

Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.

Request for Improvement
To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline.
More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.

I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.

Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.
Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:


This course is quite hard
Here‚Äôs students‚Äô feedback:

It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # #
Now it‚Äôs hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
LLMs grade you ‚Äì unpredictably. # #
The ROE is hard. #

Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you‚Äôre ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It‚Äôll be too tough for you now.


TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help
Again to quote Anand:


We encourage learning by sharing
You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
Why should you copy? Because in real life, there‚Äôs no time to re-invent the wheel. You‚Äôll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It‚Äôs important to learn how to do that well.
To learn well, understand what you‚Äôre copying. If you‚Äôre short of time, prioritize.
To learn better, teach what you‚Äôve learnt.


Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).
Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.
Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just ‚Äútools‚Äù, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
@22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn‚Äôt be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I‚Äôm speaking for a lot of my peers that we‚Äôre not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.
I‚Äôm a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.
While grades don‚Äôt matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I‚Äôm so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.
I understand that the grading can‚Äôt be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

Nicely highlighted the concern of all students.
TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It‚Äôs a headache for those with non-technical background.
IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.

Dam‚Ä¶ Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I‚Äôm still getting dragged into this   ‚Ä¶

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital image of a modified emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **The Emoji:** The main focus is a large, round, yellow emoji with a wide, open mouth in a joyful expression.¬†The eyes are closed, further suggesting happiness or perhaps relief.  The emoji has a rosy pink tongue and a slightly rosy blush on its cheeks.  It has a simplistic design, typical of emojis used in digital communication.

* **The Modification:** A single, light-blue droplet of liquid is positioned to the upper right of the emoji, as if it's dripping down. This could imply sweating due to exertion, relief, or even just being hot.

* **The Background:**  Part of the background is visible. It appears to be a muted orange-yellow, similar in tone to the emoji's skin color, providing a somewhat blended and indistinct backdrop. The background is not clearly defined, suggesting a cropped or partially obscured image.

The overall impression is one of lightheartedness and possibly relief or joyful exhaustion, conveyed through the combination of the laughing emoji and the single sweat drop.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up shot of a laughing emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Emoji:** The main focus is a large, round yellow emoji with a wide, open-mouthed laugh.  The eyes are squeezed shut, represented by two angled black lines. The mouth is a large, curved line, indicating a hearty laugh.¬†A small, pink tongue is visible sticking out from the bottom of the mouth.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, slightly darker shade of orange/yellow, creating a subtle contrast with the emoji's brighter yellow. The background color is slightly out of focus, drawing the viewer's attention to the central emoji.

* **Style:** The emoji style is typical of modern digital emoticons; smooth, rounded edges, and bright, solid colors.  It looks similar to those found on messaging apps and social media platforms.

The overall image is simple, cheerful, and easily recognizable as an expression of laughter.

**Image 3**: That's an emoji depicting a face laughing so hard it's crying.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** The overall shape is roughly circular or slightly hexagonal, giving it a slightly three-dimensional look.

* **Color:** The main body of the face is a bright, golden yellow.

* **Eyes:** The eyes are squinted shut, represented by two small, black, V-shaped lines.

* **Mouth:** The mouth is wide open in a large, exaggerated smile, showing a pink interior.¬†The smile extends almost to the edges of the face.

* **Tears:**¬†Two large, bright blue teardrops are streaming down from the eyes, indicating intense laughter to the point of tears.  The teardrops have highlights suggesting light reflecting off their surfaces.

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and exaggerated, typical of modern emoji designs. The lines are slightly rough around the edges, giving it a less polished, more hand-drawn feel.


The overall impression is one of unrestrained, joyful laughter.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's an emoji!¬†


Specifically, it's a yellow circle representing a face with a neutral or unimpressed expression.¬†The features are simple, consisting of two short horizontal lines for eyes and a longer horizontal line for a mouth.  The lines are dark brown or black, contrasting against the bright yellow of the face. The overall style is simple and flat, characteristic of common emoji designs.  The image has a slightly pixelated or low-resolution appearance.

**Image 2**: That's Hobbes, the tiger from the comic strip *Calvin and Hobbes*!

The image shows Hobbes in a characteristic pose, lying down and seemingly engaged in some activity.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Hobbes:** He's depicted in his typical style: a somewhat realistic tiger, but with exaggerated features that give him a cuddly, cartoonish look. His fur is orange and black with white accents.¬†He appears to be lying on his belly.¬†His expression is not clearly defined, but he seems relaxed or perhaps playful.

* **Activity:**  It's difficult to definitively say what Hobbes is doing. He appears to be interacting with something unseen, possibly playing with a toy or a piece of paper, suggested by a faint line extending from his paws.

* **Style:** The art style is consistent with Bill Watterson's signature style for *Calvin and Hobbes*, characterized by simple lines, expressive details, and a whimsical quality.

* **Background:** The background is mostly white with a few very light smudges or speckles, suggesting a simple, uncluttered setting.

The image is small and somewhat blurry, but the distinctive features of Hobbes make him easily recognizable.

Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital image of a simple yellow smiley face emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** A perfect circle.
* **Color:** Solid, bright yellow.
* **Eyes:** Two small, dark (almost black) circles, positioned relatively close together, slightly above the horizontal center.
* **Mouth:** A simple, slightly curved line that forms a subtle smile.¬†It's not a wide grin, but a more reserved, content expression.
* **Style:** The emoji is minimal and cartoonish in style, lacking much detail.  The lines are not thick, and the overall appearance is smooth.

The background is transparent, which is common for emojis used digitally.
