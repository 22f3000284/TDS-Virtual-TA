Hi @carlton,
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn‚Äôt locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a spreadsheet, likely from Google Sheets or a similar program.¬†


The spreadsheet displays data organized in rows and columns. The columns are labeled A through J, and the rows contain information about different series of PPI (Producer Price Index) industry data.¬†


Two distinct data sets are shown, each beginning with "PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing..." followed by a specific type of pharmaceutical preparation (Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations in the first set; Calcium channel blockers in the second).


Each data set includes the following information:

* **Series Title:**¬†A descriptive title of the data series.
* **Series ID:** A unique alphanumeric identifier for the series.
* **Seasonality:** Indicates whether the data is seasonally adjusted ("Not Seasonally Adjusted" in both instances).
* **Survey Name:**¬†The name of the survey from which the data is derived.
* **Measure Data Ty:** The specific type of pharmaceutical being measured.
* **Industry:**¬†The industry sector to which the data applies.
* **Item:**  The specific item within the industry being measured.


The spreadsheet appears clean and well-organized. The data is neatly aligned within each cell. The background is white, and the text is predominantly black. The cells are clearly defined by grid lines.

Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a question and instructions for a data analysis assignment.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Heading:** "Question 7.1" is prominently displayed at the top in a dark teal box.

* **Scenario:** A detailed scenario is provided, explaining that a political party wants to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical exports from India to the US on India's economy.  Key information includes the export value (‚Çπ2,42,888 Crores) and the fiscal year (FY 2024).

* **Provided Files:** Two CSV files are mentioned as being provided for the analysis: "Industry Product Segment Information" and "Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)".

* **Tasks:** A numbered list of tasks outlines the steps students need to perform:
    * Create a new Google Sheet workbook with a specific naming convention.
    * Share the workbook with a specific email address.  The instructions emphasize that this sharing step is mandatory.
    * Ensure that the sheet names within the workbook match the instructions.
    * Create a pivot table with specific columns and rows.


* **Overall Appearance:** The text is clear and well-organized. The use of bolding and numbering enhances readability. The background is a light gray/off-white color.  The top of the image shows a portion of a form, indicating this is likely a form for submitting online coursework.

The image is essentially a detailed assignment prompt for a data analysis project using Google Sheets and provided CSV datasets.

@Jivraj
In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are

but the dataset provided has no column named ‚ÄúItem‚Äù

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image contains a single line of text, which appears to be a numbered point or instruction.¬†


The text reads: "4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value."


The font is simple and sans-serif, likely a standard typeface used in documents or spreadsheets. The numbering "4." indicates this is part of a larger list or set of instructions.  The phrase "Sheet1" suggests this is referring to a spreadsheet or table, and the rest of the sentence describes the column headers present within that sheet.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a portion of a spreadsheet or table, likely from a data analysis program.¬†


The table has five columns, with headers labeled: "Series ID", "Year", "Period", "Label", and "Value".¬†


The first row under the headers shows data for one entry:

* **Series ID:** PCU3254-3254-
* **Year:** 2023
* **Period:** M01
* **Label:** 2023 Jan
* **Value:** 562.445

A second row is partially visible, indicating more data exists beyond the visible portion.  A snippet of the second row shows data related to the year 2023 and the month Feb but cut-off.

The style is simple, with dark gray headers and white cells for the data. The font is sans-serif and plain. The overall appearance suggests a clean, functional data presentation.

PCU3254123254127114
Calcium channel blockers


PCU325412325412MM
Miscellaneous receipts


PCU325412325412D112OC

Some items don‚Äôt have prices for all 24 months.
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a spreadsheet, likely from a Google Sheet or similar program.¬†


**Content:**

The spreadsheet contains data organized in rows and columns.¬†The first column (A) lists various pharmaceutical items, such as "ACE inhibitors," "Analgesics," "Antidepressants," etc.¬†Columns B through H represent data categorized by year and month. Column B is labeled "Year," column C is "Month," and column C also shows "Total". Columns D through H show data for the year 2023, broken down into five months (M01 through M05). Each cell contains numerical data, presumably representing quantities or values associated with each pharmaceutical item for each month.¬†


**Visual Elements:**

* **Headers:** The spreadsheet has a clearly defined header row with labels for each column.
* **Data Organization:** The data is well-organized and aligned.
* **Color-Coding:** There is some subtle color-coding. The header row is shaded light gray.¬†
* **Highlighting:** Red arrows are drawn on the left, seemingly highlighting specific rows or groups of rows (e.g., a group including ACE inhibitors and Analgesics).¬†
* **Cell Formatting:** The numerical data in the cells appears to be formatted as numbers.¬†


**Overall Impression:**

The spreadsheet appears to be a record of pharmaceutical sales or usage, tracking quantities or values over time. The highlighting suggests specific items or groups of items are being analyzed or compared. The data seems to be organized in a way that allows for easy tracking and analysis of sales figures.
