The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

Hi Hari,
The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.
Have you watched this session in particular?
  
    
  


If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it
  
    
  


followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases
  
    
  


But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.
Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.
Kind regards

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Close-up view of a digital graphic announcing "Week 3 Session 1".Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Main Text:** The words "WEEK 3" and "SESSION 1" are prominently displayed in a large, sans-serif font. "WEEK 3" is stacked above "SESSION 1", both in white against a dark-blue rectangular banner.

* **Background Graphic:** The background behind the text banner is a peach-colored square filled with a dense collection of colorful, stylized icons representing various data and design elements. These include graphs, charts, diagrams, pencils, gears, mobile phone icons, and other abstract shapes. The style is flat and modern, reminiscent of infographic design. The icons are arranged in a somewhat chaotic yet visually appealing manner.

* **Overall Style:** The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and vibrant. The color palette is a mix of warm and cool tones, with the peach background providing a contrast to the dark-blue banner.

The image appears to be designed as a title card or announcement for a course, workshop, or online learning session, indicating the third week's first session.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a split screen.Â 


**Left Side (Larger Portion):** This displays a computer screen showing a Chrome browser window.Â The browser's tab bar shows "Meet - odh-ycbm-ahj" as the active tab, followed by "Large language models" and "Speed Dial".Â The page itself has a predominantly orange background with a stylized anime character (Naruto Uzumaki) partially visible.Â The character is in the center, dressed in his iconic orange jumpsuit. Overlaid on the orange background are several rectangular icons, each with a thumbnail image or simple icon, and short labels suggesting links to various projects, tutorials (Java, prime numbers), and documents ("App Dev II Project Doc", "TDS Discourse"). There's a Windows taskbar at the bottom, showing various applications and the current time (20:14, 11-07-2024).

**Right Side (Smaller Portion):** This section shows a dark-colored Google Meet-like screen. The name "Amit Kumar Gupta" is clearly visible at the bottom, indicating this is probably a video conferencing window showing the participant's name. A small, white circular logo with a stylized water droplet is shown above the name.Â 


Overall, the image gives the impression of someone working on various programming projects or educational materials, possibly using online collaborative tools like Google Meet. The presence of the anime character indicates a personalized computer setup.

**Image 3**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a laptop screen displaying an online course module on data sourcing.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A standard web browser's top bar is visible, showing tabs for various websites, including Google services, a course platform, and even ChatGPT.Â The time and date are displayed as "Fri 12 Jul 20:22".

* **Course Navigation:** On the left side, there's a course navigation panel. This panel shows the course structure, with sections like "Course Introduction," "Self Assessment," "Data Discovery," "Data Sourcing," "Data Preparation," "Data Analysis," "Large Language Models," and "Project 1 & 2." The "Data Sourcing" section is expanded, indicating the current focus.

* **Course Content:** The main part of the screen shows the content of the "Data Sourcing" module. It includes a star rating (5 out of 5), a brief description, links to additional resources (PDF, Notebook, links to the tabula and pandas packages), and a section titled "Optional: Real-life scraping." This section includes a video embedded in the page showing a real-world web scraping example. A description under the video explains the scenario.

* **Dock:** At the very bottom of the screen, the macOS dock is visible, showing various application icons, including Chrome, Safari, Xcode, and others.


* **Video Conference:** A small embedded video in the main content area suggests a live online session. A picture-in-picture of Carlton D'Silva, presumably the instructor, appears in the bottom right corner.

The overall impression is that of a student actively engaged in an online course, focusing on a lesson related to data sourcing and web scraping. The screenshot neatly combines course content, online resources, and the instructor's presence for a comprehensive learning experience.
