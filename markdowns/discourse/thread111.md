Please post any discrepancies related to project1.
@carlton
Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
All the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us.
For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.
How to fix bugs in our scripts
Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .
Docker Image Architecture Issue Report
If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:
Submit Report
Bug fixes
If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.
Kind regards,
TDS Team

@carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.
We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it‚Äôs showing the server didn‚Äôt start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I‚Äôll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the ‚Äúserver didn‚Äôt start in 5 minutes‚Äù but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.

@carlton  same issue, My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error  and  Evaluation log file is MISSING.
Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.
I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a single, uppercase letter "D".¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Letter:** The "D" is white or light-colored, and it has a sans-serif typeface. The strokes are clean and fairly thick.

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, muted grayish-blue color.¬†It's a relatively dark and desaturated tone.

* **Overall:** The image is simple, focusing entirely on the letter. The contrast between the white "D" and the dark background makes the letter very prominent.  The image quality appears slightly blurred or slightly out of focus,  suggesting it might be a screenshot or a low-resolution image.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed screen, likely from a Docker registry or container management interface.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible information:

* **Top Left:** Shows the tag "latest" for a Docker image, indicating it's the most recent version. A green dot suggests it's the current or preferred version.¬† The "Last pushed" information states the image was uploaded about a month ago by a user named "pradeepmondal". A digest (a unique identifier) is also listed.

* **Center and Right:**  The main body displays information about the image, including the operating system and architecture ("linux/arm64/v8"), the last time it was pulled (1 day ago), and its compressed size (179.2 MB).  A button labeled "Copy" is present next to a command to pull the image using `docker pull pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest`.  This suggests the purpose is to provide users with a command to download this specific Docker image.

* **Overall:** The interface has a clean, minimalist design with dark background and light-colored text.¬†The emphasis is clearly on the image's information and the command to download it.

**Image 3**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a `podman run` command.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Command Line:** The first line shows the command executed: `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43`. This suggests running a containerized application using Podman, with environment variables and port mapping.  `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is likely an authentication token.

* **Output:** The subsequent lines are the output of the command:
    * `INFO: Started server process [1]`: Indicates the server process within the container has started.
    * `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`: Shows the application is initializing.
    * `INFO: Application startup complete.`: Confirmation that the application started successfully.
    * `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`: This is the most important line; it indicates that the Uvicorn web server (a popular ASGI server for Python) is running and accessible on port 8000 of the container (mapped to port 8000 of the host machine) and provides instructions to stop it using CTRL+C.


* **Overall:** The image captures a successful container startup and the successful launch of a web application running on Uvicorn. The terminal background is black, and the text is white, standard for terminal displays.  The arrow at the beginning indicates the prompt.

Facing the same issue sir, kindly look into it. I had made sure all the files including the docker file were working perfectly fine. Please help me out.
Roll no. 23f1002056

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a single, uppercase letter "R".¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Letter:** The "R" is sans-serif, meaning it lacks the small decorative strokes at the ends of its lines. It's rendered in a clean, simple style. The letter is white or very light-colored.

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, deep pink or magenta color.  It's fairly uniform in tone.

* **Overall:** The contrast between the white "R" and the pink background is very strong, making the letter highly visible. The image is simple and straightforward, focusing entirely on the letter itself.  There are no other elements present.

My evaluation log file is missing.
The 2 other log files i‚Äôm given doesnt have my email inside it listed.
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project‚Äôs docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07
My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.
tds-project-1              latest    c854274f078d   5 weeks ago    1.38GB
ayush6871/fastapi-agent    latest    27e8375b0ab1   6 weeks ago    1.66GB
I am requesting to look into this case. I think there has been some mistake somewhere.

@carlton Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042  , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id.
Please, look over it.
