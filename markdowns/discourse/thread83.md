@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj
Dear TDS Team,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.
1. Graded Assignments (GA)


GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)


GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.


2. Project Updates

Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.
Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?  (thread link)

3. ROE Score Update

While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.

I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.
Best regards,
Lakshay

@carlton Itâ€™s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as wellâ€”when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a striking close-up shot of a tiger!Â 


Here's a description:

* **The Tiger:** The image is dominated by a tiger's face and upper chest. The tiger is in profile, slightly angled to the viewer's left, but its gaze is directed straight ahead.Â Its mouth is open in a ferocious snarl, revealing sharp teeth and pink gums. Its expression is one of intense aggression or warning. The tiger's fur is richly colored, with the characteristic orange, black stripes, and white markings on its chest and around its mouth.Â The fur appears thick and healthy. Its whiskers are prominent.

* **The Lighting and Background:** The background is dark and out of focus, creating a stark contrast with the tiger's brightly lit face. This makes the tiger the undeniable focal point. The lighting highlights the texture of the tiger's fur and the details of its face.

* **Overall Impression:** The image is powerful and dramatic. The close-up perspective, combined with the tiger's aggressive posture and the dark background, creates a sense of intensity and potential danger. It's a captivating and memorable photograph.

The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.
With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.
GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.

Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.


Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.
Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.

3. ROE Score Update

You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.
Kind regards

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.Â 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair, dark eyes, and a somewhat serious expression. He has a short, neat haircut. His skin tone is medium brown.Â He has a mustache and what looks like the beginnings of a beard.

* **Attire:** He is wearing a dark-colored suit jacket, which looks to be either black or dark gray. Underneath, he's wearing a light-colored collared shirt, likely white or light blue. The shirt is visible at the collar and cuffs.

* **Background:** The background is plain and light-colored, possibly white or off-white. It's unblemished and doesn't distract from the subject.

* **Image Quality:** The image is a headshot, fairly sharply focused on the man's face. The resolution isn't exceptionally high, but it's clear enough to see facial features. There's a slight possibility of compression artifacts, common in digital images.

Overall, it's a standard professional headshot, likely for use on a website or official document.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.Â 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair, dark eyes, and a somewhat serious expression. He has a short, neat haircut. His skin tone is medium brown.Â He is clean-shaven, with a hint of stubble that might be shadow.

* **Attire:** He's wearing a dark-colored, likely black or very dark gray, suit jacket. Underneath, a lighter-colored shirt (possibly white or light blue) is visible at the collar. The shirt appears to be a dress shirt.

* **Background:** The background is plain and light-colored, possibly white or off-white. It's unfocused, drawing attention to the man in the foreground.

* **Image Quality:** The image is a standard passport or profile photo style; the focus is sharp on the man's face, but the resolution isn't exceptionally high.  There is a small, barely legible marking in the bottom right corner, which may be a watermark or signature.

Overall, the image is a fairly typical formal portrait often used for identification purposes.

**Image 3**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.Â 


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair and brown eyes. He has a somewhat serious expression. His facial hair is neatly trimmed. His skin tone is medium brown.

* **Attire:** He's wearing a dark-colored, possibly black or dark gray, suit jacket over a light-colored, possibly white or light blue, collared shirt. The jacket appears to be well-fitting.

* **Background:** The background is plain and light-colored, almost white, which keeps the focus entirely on the man.Â There is a very faint, indistinct mark or smudge visible in the upper right corner.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is decent, but not exceptionally sharp. It seems to be a fairly standard passport-style or professional headshot photograph.  There's a slight shadow under his chin.


The overall impression is that this is a professional headshot, possibly for a resume or LinkedIn profile.

Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.
The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.
We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.
Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.
Looking forward to your response.
Regards,
Lakshay
