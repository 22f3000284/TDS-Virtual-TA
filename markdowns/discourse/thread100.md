Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.
(roughly 3 days before end term).
Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj
What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We canâ€™t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

You were sent an email about it. With the peers to review. It came from the official TDS email.
You were sent an email on the 1st of April.
Kind regards

Hi @carlton sir,
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.
Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Gmail inbox view on a computer screen.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Gmail Interface:** The top displays the standard Gmail interface with the Gmail logo, a search bar (containing "peer review"), and various options like "Mail," "Conversations," "Spaces," search filters ("From," "Any time," "Has attachment," "To"), and "Advanced search." Standard Gmail icons and controls are present.

* **Email List:** The majority of the screen shows a list of emails.  Each email displays:
    * A checkbox.
    * A star icon (some are starred).
    * The subject line of the email.
    * A timestamp.
    * Attachment icons indicating the presence of files.  The file names are visible, including `.html` extensions, suggesting they might be web pages or forms.

* **Highlighted Emails:** Several email entries are highlighted.  Two specific emails have their attachment links surrounded by pink boxes. This suggests the user is focused on these specific emails, likely containing peer review materials.

* **Email Content Snippets:** Short snippets of the email subject lines and body are visible, indicating they are related to peer reviews, bonus marks, and task allocations.

* **Bottom Right:** In the lower right corner, the bottom part of the Gmail message shows the timestamp "Apr 1", suggesting the date of the emails.  Also visible is the text "IIT Madras," which may indicate the sender or recipient's affiliation.

The overall impression is that the user is managing peer reviews using Google Forms, likely for a course or assignment, based on the visible file names and email snippets. The highlighting suggests they are actively working on reviewing or submitting these forms.

Thanks we have made a correction and sent an email.
