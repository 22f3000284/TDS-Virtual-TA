    * A crucial instruction to use the student ID for access.
    * A direct link to the assignment.

* **Visual Elements:** The use of checkboxes, expandable menu items, and a warning icon are typical of an LMS interface.


Overall, the screenshot shows a student's view of an online course, specifically focusing on a graded assignment that has passed its deadline but allows further submissions. The instructions provided emphasize troubleshooting potential technical problems.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be an online assessment or quiz platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A red bar at the very top displays "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" indicating the completion time of the assessment, followed by "Score: 0," and buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save."

* **Questions/Discussion Section:** Below the top bar is a dark teal box with a speech bubble icon and the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse," providing a link to a discussion forum.

* **Login Information:** A dark gray area displays the message "You are logged in as 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." with a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves:** Further down, there's a section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)." This section shows three entries, each with a "Reload" button, a timestamp, and a score of 6.5.  The dates are all from February 2nd, 2025.

* **Handwritten Note:** Prominently displayed across the screen is a handwritten annotation reading "week 2," indicating that this assessment might be part of a two-week program or series.


The overall color scheme is dark, using predominantly dark gray and teal, creating a clean and somewhat minimalist interface. The handwritten note contrasts with the digital elements, suggesting a personal annotation made by the user. The platform seems designed for educational or training purposes, judging by the login details and the "Discourse" mention.

**Image 3**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely a student's online learning portal. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Left:** Displays "IIT Madras" and "Jan 2025-TDS," suggesting the institution and course information.

* **Left Side Navigation:** A vertical menu lists modules of a course: "Course Introduction," "Module 1: Development Tools," "Module 2: Deployment Tools," "Module 3: Large Language Models," "Project 1," "Module 4: Data Sourcing," and finally, "Graded Assignment 4" (highlighted with a red circle).  The menu shows a tree structure, some modules being expanded and some collapsed.

* **Right Side Content:** The main area shows information related to "Graded Assignment 4".  It prominently states that the due date has passed (showing the past due date) and provides instructions on how to access the assignment. The instructions address potential access issues, mentioning ad blockers, cookies, Javascript, browser extensions, antivirus software, and network policies as possible obstacles. It specifically recommends using Chrome Browser and a student's unique ID for access. A link to the assignment is clearly visible.

* **Overall Style:** The website interface appears clean and organized, utilizing a simple color scheme (mainly gray and white).


The screenshot suggests a student is trying to access a graded assignment that's past its due date but still allows for submission. The provided troubleshooting steps indicate a focus on technical aspects that might prevent access.

* **Bonus Marks Section:** A dark-grey box details bonus marks for participating in a discussion forum ("Discourse"). It specifies that IITM BS students who contribute to a particular discussion thread ("GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]") will receive a bonus mark.

* **Login Information:** Below the bonus marks section, it states the user is logged in using a specific email address: "23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". A "Logout" button is provided.

* **Handwritten Note:** A prominent handwritten "week 4" is centered on the screen, possibly indicating the week of the assignment.

* **Recent Saves Section:** Near the bottom, a section labeled "Recent saves" displays a history of the user's saved scores with timestamps and individual scores (8, 8, and 4). Each entry has a "Reload" button.

@24ds3000061 @22f2001532
Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.
GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.
Kind regards

* **Bonus Marks Section:** A light green box announces "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse." The text explains that students who reply to a specific discussion thread on GA4 - Data Sourcing will receive a bonus mark on a graded assignment.  The Discussion Thread is identified as "[TDS Jan 2025]".

* **Login Status:** Below the bonus marks section, the system displays a message confirming the user is logged in, showing a specific email address that ends with "@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," suggesting a university or educational institution. A "Logout" button is also present.

* **Recent Saves Section:** Another light green box shows "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)".  Three entries are listed, each showing a "Reload" button, a date and time stamp (all in 09/02/2025), and a score (8, 8, and 7).


The overall style is clean and simple, typical of online learning platforms. The color scheme is primarily light green and red.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying an online exam interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A typical browser tab bar is visible at the very top, showing the title of the exam ("Programming Assignment-1 ... Graded Assignment 3: TM OXTOS 2025 Jan GA3-Large Langu X") and the URL.

* **Exam Instructions:** A large red banner at the top indicates the exam has ended, showing the time and date.  Below this are numbered instructions for the exam takers. These instructions emphasize the ability to save multiple times, the use of any resources (including ChatGPT), and that the exam is "hackable".

* **Discourse Link:** A teal-colored box invites users to join a discussion on Discourse if they have any questions.

* **Login Information:** The screen displays the user's login information, showing they are logged in with a specific ID ("2313004407@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"). A "Logout" button is also present.

* **Recent Saves:** A section displays the user's recent saved attempts, including timestamps and scores.

* **Bottom Bar:** The bottom of the screenshot shows a standard browser taskbar with various app icons, a search bar, language indicators, time, and date.

* **Overall Appearance:** The interface has a dark theme. 


The image suggests a programming or technical-based exam, given the mention of using libraries and frameworks and the nature of the instructions. The relaxed attitude towards using any resource (including hacking) indicates a unique or possibly advanced level exam.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with tan skin. He has dark hair, neatly styled, and is wearing rectangular, dark-framed glasses. He has a pleasant, somewhat reserved expression.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a purple collared shirt. The shirt appears to be a polo-style shirt.

* **Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige or tan color, which is fairly untextured and out of focus, drawing all attention to the man.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low resolution; it's a bit blurry and pixelated, especially noticeable in the background and around the edges of his hair and glasses.  It's likely a digitally compressed or low-quality photograph.


Overall, the image is a simple, fairly standard headshot, likely taken for professional purposes like a profile picture for online use.
