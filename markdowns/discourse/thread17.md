I wanted to seek clarification regarding the deadline for GA2. The latest email received today mentions the deadline as 26th January, whereas an earlier email stated 2nd February, which is also reflected on the dashboard.
Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion?

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of an email.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Sender:** The sender's email address is "donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in," indicating it's an automated or system-generated message, likely from an educational institution (possibly the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, judging by the domain name).

* **Recipient:** The "to" field shows "25t1_se2002-announce," suggesting a mailing list or group announcement.

* **Salutation:** The email begins with a formal salutation, "Dear Learner,"

* **Body:** The main body contains a concise message informing the recipient of a deadline: "The deadline for the Week 1 & 2 Graded Assignment is 26/01/2025 23:59 Hrs." This indicates that a graded assignment for weeks 1 and 2 is due on January 26th, 2025, at 11:59 PM.

* **Closing:** A closing is provided: "Warm Regards, IITM BS Team," indicating the message originates from an IITM BS (likely Bachelor of Science) team.

* **Timestamp:**Â In the top right corner, a timestamp is visible: "12:23 PM (7 minutes ago)," indicating when the screenshot was taken relative to the email's arrival.

The overall appearance is simple and clean, typical of a plain-text email format. The text is black on a white background.
