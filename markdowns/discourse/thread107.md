This question is in 2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2
Can anyone tell how to solve this?

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a quiz question from a website called "quizpractice.space".¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A typical browser window's top bar is visible, showing the URL of the quiz question, back and forward navigation buttons, and other browser controls.¬†Several tabs related to the course are also visible including, "IIT Website," "Discourse," "AceGrade," and others.

* **Quiz Interface:** The main part of the screen displays a quiz interface.¬†The left side shows information about the exam: the exam name ("End Term Quiz"), subject ("TDS"), total marks (40.00), and question number (currently on question 24 of 40).  There's a question menu showing the number of questions.  Buttons for "Exam Mode" and "Learning Mode" are displayed.

* **Question Text:** The central area displays the question itself. The question involves calculating the distance between two locations using the Haversine formula. It provides the latitude and longitude coordinates for two locations (Location A and Location B) and asks for a step-by-step explanation of how to use the Haversine formula to solve the problem. The word "Haversine" is prominently highlighted.

* **Bottom Bar:**¬†A Windows taskbar is visible at the very bottom, showing various open applications and the time (6:00 PM).

Overall, the image shows a student working on a geographical distance calculation problem using the Haversine formula within an online quiz environment. The layout is clean and primarily dark-themed.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a quiz or exam question on a website called "quizpractice.space".¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A standard browser window's top bar is visible, showing the URL of the quiz question, several browser buttons (back, forward, refresh, etc.), and some bookmarks or extensions.¬†

* **Left Sidebar:** A dark-themed sidebar displays information about the exam, including the exam name ("End Term Quiz"), subject ("TDS"), total marks, question number, and a question menu showing a numbered list of questions (1-40).¬† It also has options for "Exam Mode" and "Learning Mode".

* **Main Content:** The majority of the screen shows the question itself. It appears to be a question involving the Haversine formula for calculating distances on a sphere (likely Earth). The question is broken down into steps: converting degrees to radians, calculating differences in latitude and longitude, and applying the Haversine formula itself.  Mathematical formulas and equations are prominently displayed. There's a student response at the bottom indicating the conversion of latitude and longitude to radians for two locations (A and B). The student is asking if their conversions are correct.

* **Right Sidebar (Partially Visible):** A small portion of a right sidebar is visible, suggesting further information or options might be present, but it's mostly cut off from view.

* **Bottom Bar:** A Windows taskbar is visible at the very bottom, showing the time and some open applications.

The overall impression is that the screenshot captures a student working on a geospatial calculation problem in an online learning environment. The question is technical and involves mathematical formulas. The dark theme of the quiz platform and the clean layout contribute to a professional and organized appearance.

**Image 3**: Here's a description of the image:

Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A browser window's top bar shows the website address, several browser extensions/icons (including what seems to be a grading tool, and possibly a few programming language icons), and standard browser controls. The title bar indicates it's a practice question from a "Practice TDS questions" set.

* **Left Panel:** A dark-themed side panel shows details about the exam:  "End Term Quiz," the subject ("TDS"), total marks (40.00), the question paper's details (QP), and a "Question Menu" displaying numbered buttons (1-40), highlighting button 19.  There are options for "Exam Mode" and "Learning Mode."

* **Main Panel:** The central area displays the quiz question. It involves calculating the distance in meters between two locations using the Haversine formula. The coordinates for the "Emergency Supply Center" and "Eastview Medical Center" are provided.  Multiple-choice answers are presented beneath the question.

* **Bottom Bar:** A standard Windows taskbar is visible at the very bottom of the screen.

The overall style is clean and functional, typical of an online learning or testing platform. The color scheme is predominantly dark, making text easy to read against the background.

* **Quiz Interface (Left Side):** The left side of the screen displays quiz information:
    * "Exam:" "End Term Quiz"
    * "Subject:" "TDS"
    * "Total Marks:" "40.00"
    * "QP:" "2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2" (This likely refers to a question paper identifier).
    * Buttons: "Exam Mode" and "Learning Mode"
    * A numbered question menu showing progress through the quiz (questions 1-40).  Question 20 is highlighted, suggesting the current question.

* **Quiz Question (Right Side):** The main part of the screen displays the question: The response team needs to deliver to the nearest hospital.  The location of an emergency supply center is given (Latitude and Longitude).  Four hospital options are listed, each with its own Latitude and Longitude coordinates.¬†

* **Bottom Bar:** A standard Windows taskbar is partially visible at the bottom, with icons for various applications.

* **Other Elements:** There are buttons for "Discussions," "Print," and a camera icon (likely for image uploads).
