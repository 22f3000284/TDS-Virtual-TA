@carlton @jkmadathil Sir please shift the ROE date to another date because we really need time to understand all these stuffs as these are so hard for beginners like us and there is quiz 2 and we have to prepare for that also.
Sir please understand our situation and pay attention to our concern.

Also, it seems impossible to complete it in 45 minutes.

you got the wrong Anand here.  You perhaps wanted to tag the faculty of this course s.anand (Iâ€™m purposely not tagging him; you may do so)

I feel for you because you constantly get incorrectly tagged. On the plus side you are famous (or infamous depending on perspective  )
Kind regards

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a winking emoji.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Emoji:** It's a classic yellow circle representing a face. The style is simple, with a wide, slightly curved smile and one eye closed in a wink, while the other eye is a simple, small black dot. The eyebrows are short, slightly curved lines.

* **The Color:** The emoji is predominantly bright yellow, with black features for the eyes, eyebrows, and smile.Â There's a subtle orange background visible at the edges, suggesting the emoji might be cropped from a larger image or app screen.

* **The Style:** The emoji style is consistent with common depictions found on digital platforms and messaging appsâ€”a smooth, simple design without much shading or detail.

The overall impression is a cheerful, playful, and slightly conspiratorial feeling, typical of the winking emoji's intended meaning.

Just FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is @s.anand
Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme. Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.
Kind regards

Sir can you at least increase the time limit from 45 minutes to 1 hour?

The time limit for ROE will be set according to the difficulty level of the ROE.
Kind regards
