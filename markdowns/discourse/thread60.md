Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Are we allowed to do that?

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don‚Äôt think they will permit this.

Sharing answers is asking for help

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right?
Only for today‚Äôs ROE(mock 2) we can split  the tasks efficiently and get it done.
Thoughts?

this is valid. should we just ask them? Could u message a TA?

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a logo.¬†


Here's a description:

The image shows a simple logo featuring a capital letter "T" in white against a solid Kelly green background. The "T" is sans-serif, clean, and relatively thick.¬†There's a subtle, barely perceptible texture or pattern around the letter, possibly a light speckled effect or a soft glow, which could be a stylistic choice to add visual interest.  The overall impression is simple, modern, and somewhat understated.

What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? Tools in Data Science
  
  
    @ankit.jain ‚Äì I‚Äôm the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is ‚ÄúHow much can they answer if woken up from sleep?‚Äù
Explicit learning is ‚ÄúHow much can they answer given time and Internet?‚Äù

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They‚Äôll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That‚Äôs explicit learning. But it takes time‚Ä¶

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a portrait of a man, appearing to be a painting or a digitally enhanced photograph.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Subject:** The man is light-skinned, with short, slightly receding light brown or graying hair. He appears middle-aged. His expression is somewhat pensive or serious, with his gaze directed slightly away from the viewer. He's wearing what seems to be a dark-colored, possibly brown or gray, collared shirt or jacket.  Part of his glasses is visible on his face.

* **The Lighting:** The lighting is dramatic, with strong chiaroscuro (strong contrasts between light and shadow).¬†A significant portion of his face is in shadow, particularly the left side (from the viewer's perspective), while the right side is more brightly lit, creating a three-dimensional effect. The lighting suggests a single light source from the right.

* **The Style:** The style evokes a classical or perhaps slightly romanticized portraiture feel. The soft blending of colors and the attention to shadow and light suggest a painterly technique, even if the original might have been a photograph.  The background is a uniform, indistinct reddish-brown tone, keeping the focus entirely on the subject.

* **Image Quality:** The image itself is somewhat low resolution or compressed, which gives it a slightly grainy or blurry appearance, especially noticeable in the shadowed areas.


Overall, the image creates a mood of contemplation and seriousness, due largely to the lighting and the subject's expression.

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's the logo for Discord, a popular VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution platform.¬†


Here's a description of the image:

* **Shape:** The logo is a circle.

* **Color:** The background of the circle is a solid, medium-toned periwinkle blue or purplish-blue.

* **Icon:**¬†Superimposed on the blue circle is a white stylized face or mascot.¬†It's essentially a simplified, cartoonish head with rounded, somewhat square features.¬†It has two small, round, dark-blue eyes (though they appear dark-blue only because of the contrast with the white; they are not actually different colored shapes) and a slightly open, smiling mouth. The overall shape gives a friendly and approachable feel.

* **Style:** The style is simple, clean, and minimalist. The design is easily recognizable and memorable.
