The deadlines mentioned in the Grading Document provided and the TDS website (s-anand.net) are different. Project-1â€™s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?
Not affecting me particularly, however, itâ€™s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the studentsâ€¦

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a detailed course outline or syllabus, likely for a Data Science Diploma program.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the information presented:

* **Course Title:** "6. Tools in Data Science (Diploma in DS)" is prominently displayed at the top.

* **Assessment Details:** The core of the image is a table outlining various assessments:

    * **ROE1:** A Remote Online Exam with specifics on duration (45 minutes), access (open internet), and assessment type (objective).  Dates and times are clearly indicated.
    * **P1 & P2:** Two take-home projects, also open internet, with separate open and submission dates.
    * **GAA:** A score based on the best 4 out of 7 weekly assignments.  These are open internet, multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
    * **F:** The final end-term exam, which is in-person and requires no internet access.

* **Grading and Weighting:** The syllabus clearly explains how the final course score (T) is calculated, showing the weighting given to each assessment component (GAA, ROE1, P1, P2, F). There are two slightly different formulas provided.

* **Important Dates:**  The document lists specific open and submission dates for each assessment, including the end-term exam date.Â 

* **Eligibility Criteria:** The document outlines the requirements for attending the end-term exam (average of best 2 out of first 5 weekly assessments >= 40/100) and for obtaining the course grade (attending the end-term exam).


The overall presentation is structured and well-organized, typical of an academic course syllabus.  The use of bold font and clear headings aids readability.
