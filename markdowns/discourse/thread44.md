@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.
Shall I just change the name of the file from ‚Äòdockerfile‚Äô to ‚ÄòDockerfile‚Äô in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be ‚ÄúDockerfile‚Äù indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like

Is the GitHub repo public?
Does it have an MIT license?
Does it have a DockerFile?
Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.
I have renamed the ‚ÄòLICENSE‚Äô file as ‚ÄòMIT LICENSE‚Äô.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image contains two lines of text.¬†


The first line states a checklist failure: "No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE; No Dockerfile". This indicates a submission failed to meet three criteria:  it lacks a repository, a file named LICENSE containing "MIT" (suggesting it doesn't have an MIT license), and a Dockerfile.


The second line provides instructions: "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring." This explains that meeting the checklist requirements is a prerequisite for the submission to be evaluated.

The text is simple, sans-serif, and likely from a digital source (e.g., a log file or automated feedback message).  The overall impression is a technical, possibly automated, evaluation of a submission.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn‚Äôt changed on GitHub repo.
Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too ‚ÄúRename dockerfile to Dokerfile‚Äù . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.
Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.
Warm Regards,
Satvik Sawhney

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a file explorer or version control system (like Git) interface, displaying a list of files and folders within a project.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **File/Folder Structure:** The left column shows a hierarchical structure of files and folders.¬†The folders are indicated by a folder icon, and files are shown with a document icon.  Folders include "Business," "Operations," "app," and files include "Dockerfile," "LICENSE," and "README.md".

* **Commit History/Changes:** The central column displays a description of changes made to each file or folder.  These entries seem to be related to software development, with descriptions like "Reconfigured tasks," "Updated Dockerfile," and "Rename dockerfile."

* **Timestamps:** The right column shows timestamps indicating when each change was made, such as "2 days ago," "yesterday," and "3 days ago."

* **Icons:** Small icons to the far right might indicate different types of actions or status associated with each entry.

* **Dark Theme:** The interface uses a dark theme with light-colored text on a black background, which is common in many code editors and development tools.


Overall, the screenshot strongly suggests a developer's workflow view, possibly a project's version history within a collaborative development platform.  The consistent use of timestamps and descriptions of changes points to a log of recent activities on the project.
