### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here is a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying an online quiz or exam titled "TDS 2025 Jan ROE".Â 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** A browser window's top bar is visible, showing tabs and standard browser controls.  Part of a URL is visible, indicating the exam is hosted on a website.

* **Exam Header:**Â The header clearly displays "TDS 2025 Jan ROE," indicating the name of the exam or quiz.

* **Instructions:** A section titled "Instructions" provides detailed guidelines for taking the exam. These instructions cover checking answers, saving progress, handling browser issues, permitted resources (including using the internet, ChatGPT, etc.), and even the possibility of "hacking" the code to find answers.

* **Bonus Mark Section:** A section explains how to obtain a bonus mark by filling out a form before a specific deadline. This bonus is only for IITM students.

* **Help Section:** A teal box provides contact information for students who have questions or technical issues, specifically directing them to a Discourse forum and optionally a Google Meet session.

* **Login Information:** The user's login information (partially obscured email address) is displayed, along with a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves:** A "Recent saves" section shows the timestamps and scores of the user's previous attempts at the quiz.

* **Footer:** A small footer with system information is partially visible.

* **Operating System:** The overall visual style suggests a Windows operating system.


The overall appearance is clean and dark-themed. The instructions are quite open-ended, suggesting a flexible and perhaps less traditional approach to online assessment.

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.
If not then, you will be marked absent.
