GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science
  
  
    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a blurry, low-resolution image of a man. 


Here's what can be observed:

* **The Man:** He appears to be middle-aged, with dark hair (possibly dark brown or black) and a mustache. His skin tone is medium. He's wearing a horizontally striped shirt with dark and light stripes (possibly navy and light blue or gray) and jeans. His expression seems somewhat relaxed or neutral.

* **The Setting:** The background is extremely out of focus, making it difficult to identify anything specific. It appears to be an outdoor setting or possibly an indoor space with a lot of activity or clutter, indicated by the indistinct shapes and colors in the background.

* **Image Quality:** The image is significantly blurred, lacking sharpness and detail. The colors are somewhat muted and washed out. The overall quality suggests it might be an old photograph or a picture taken with a low-quality camera or in poor lighting conditions.


Because of the poor image quality, it's impossible to provide a more precise description of the setting, the man's exact age, or the details of his clothing.

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.
Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.
The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.
As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.
Kind regards

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a man. 


Here's a description based on the image:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with tan skin and dark hair. He's wearing glasses with dark frames. His expression is neutral to slightly pleasant, almost a small smile. His hair is short and neatly styled.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a purple collared shirt.

* **Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige color, fairly uniform and untextured. It's a simple, uncluttered backdrop that focuses attention on the man.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low-resolution; it's not extremely sharp, and there's a slight softness to the details.  It might be a compressed image or a scan of a lower-quality print.


Overall, the image is a straightforward headshot, likely a profile picture or part of a larger set of identification photos.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a graded assignment webpage. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A standard browser window's top bar is visible, showing the website address (`exam.sanandworkers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3`), the title "Graded Assignment 3," and other browser controls.

* **Red Banner:** A prominent red banner at the top declares "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and displays a score of "0". Buttons for "Check all" and "Save" are present.

* **Instructions:** Below the banner are clear instructions for the assignment. They explicitly state that students can use any resources (internet, AI tools, etc.), and that hacking the code is allowed.  The instructions highlight the need to run multiple servers concurrently.

* **Discourse Forum Link:** A light-teal box offers a link to join a discussion on Discourse for any questions.

* **Login Information:** It shows the user is logged in with an email address ending in `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. A logout button is provided.

* **Recent Saves:** A section displays recent answer saves, each with a timestamp, score (all 8), and a "Reload" button.

* **Questions Section:** The bottom shows a "Questions" heading, suggesting the main part of the assignment is yet to be displayed. A search bar is visible.

* **Taskbar:** A Windows taskbar is seen at the bottom, showcasing various application icons. The system clock and language settings are visible.


The overall impression is that this is an online exam or assignment with unusually permissive rules, allowing students to leverage any available resources, including hacking the code itself. The red banner strongly emphasizes that the time limit has passed.

Dear Bhavanagv,
The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.
Kind regards

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-green rectangular box containing a list of recent saves. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Title:** At the top, in a light-green/teal color, is the title "Recent saves".

* **Save Entries:** Below the title are three entries, each showing:
    * A blue button labeled "Reload".  This suggests the user can reload a saved game state.
    * A timestamp indicating the date and time of the save (all entries are from February 2nd, 2025, between 9:04:51 PM and 9:04:58 PM).
    * A score, which is 4 in all three saves.

* **Highlight/Selection:** A small red dot is visible to the left of the top save entry.  This likely indicates the currently selected or highlighted save.

* **Overall Appearance:** The dark-green background contrasts sharply with the lighter text and buttons. The style suggests a game interface or a similar application.

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and  GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying what appears to be an online exam or quiz. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A red bar at the top shows the date and time the exam ended ("Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"), the current score (0), and buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save". A small, circular icon, possibly indicating a notification or alert, is in the top right corner.

* **Instructions:** A numbered list of instructions provides guidance on how to take the exam. Key points include checking answers multiple times, saving frequently, the tolerance for reloading, the permissibility of using external resources (including ChatGPT), and the possibility of hacking the code to find answers. It also mentions that multiple servers are running simultaneously.

* **Discourse Link:** A teal-colored box near the middle provides a link to a discussion forum on Discourse for those who have questions.

* **Login Information:** Below the instructions, it displays the user's login email address, "23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", and a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves:** A section labeled "Recent saves" lists the user's previous saved attempts, showing the timestamps and corresponding scores (6, 6, and 4.5). Each entry has a "Reload" button.

* **Overall Style:** The overall design is dark-themed, with a predominantly dark gray or black background and contrasting brighter-colored text and buttons.  The style is clean and minimalist.


The image suggests a technologically advanced and open exam environment where students are encouraged to use various resources and methods to solve the problems, even including "hacking" the code (likely within acceptable bounds).

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **Man's Appearance:** He appears to be of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, with dark hair, brown eyes, and medium-brown skin. He's wearing rectangular, dark-framed glasses. His expression is pleasant and somewhat reserved, with a slight smile. His hair is short and neatly styled.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a purple collared shirt, which seems to be made of a relatively smooth material.

* **Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige color, providing a simple, uncluttered backdrop that focuses attention on the man.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low-resolution. It's slightly blurry, and the colors aren't incredibly sharp or vibrant.  This suggests it might be a smaller, compressed version of a larger photograph, or a photo taken with a lower-quality camera.


Overall, the image is a straightforward headshot suitable for a profile picture or identification purposes.

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as 4.25, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored 7.25 shown after submission.
Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.
