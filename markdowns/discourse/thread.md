Dear all,
Iâ€™m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator.  This is the basic prototype.
This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.
A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand, our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.
Iâ€™d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

Expand functionality and evaluation models.
Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!
Update: here is a video explaining the process - https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared
Best regards,
Avinash Shrivastava

Hi Avinash,
Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.
Kind regards

Thanks @carlton  I would definitely refine it.

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a digital emoticon, specifically a smiling emoji with rosy cheeks.Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Emoticon:** The emoji is circular, predominantly bright yellow, representing a smiling face.Â The smile is a simple, curved line, suggesting genuine happiness.Â The eyes are closed in a way that indicates contentment or perhaps shyness, and small, light pink circles are placed on either side of the face, depicting rosy cheeks.

* **The Background:**Â The background is a slightly darker, muted orange that forms a partial border around the emoji. Only a small portion of the background is visible on the left-hand side of the image.  The color is consistent with the overall warm tone of the emoji.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish, typical of emojis used in digital communication. The lines are smooth, and the colors are solid and vibrant.

The overall impression is one of warmth, happiness, and cuteness.
