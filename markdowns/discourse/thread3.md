I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.
The grading assignment indicates Iâ€™m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?
Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

Yes you dont have to submit your assignments but just give the End term. Just check if you have got the I grade

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a profile picture or avatar.Â 


Here's a description:

* **The Letter:** The image is dominated by a capital letter "S" in a sans-serif typeface. The "S" is clean and simple, without any embellishments or serifs.

* **Color:** The letter "S" is white or light-colored, and it's set against a dark teal or deep green background.

* **Style:** The overall style is minimalist and modern.  There are no other elements or details in the image except the letter and the background. The letter is centered.

The image is likely a profile picture for a social media account or online platform, where a single initial is used as an identifier.

Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course,
I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify
