Sir,
I have facing lots of difficulties in assignments and it was taking alot of time to solve a single assignment, so please extend the deadline for project 1 as it contains more weightage and it required more time to solve it.
Please kindly consider my request, as I am from non-technical background it is taking most of the time of a week because of which other Courses are suffering.
