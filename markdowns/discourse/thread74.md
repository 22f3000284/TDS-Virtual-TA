@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It‚Äôs fixed and won‚Äôt re-occur for anyone.
What happened? I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That‚Äôs what I fixed.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen, likely from an online exam or quiz platform.¬†


The screen is dark-themed, with a predominantly dark gray or black background. Several rectangular boxes are stacked vertically, each with a different function and color scheme.¬†


* **Top Box (Dark Green):** This box displays information about recent saves.¬†It indicates "No recent saves."

* **Middle Box (Dark Teal):**¬†This box shows a loading indicator ("Loading questions...") suggesting the system is attempting to retrieve exam questions.

* **Bottom Box (Dark Red):** This box displays an error message. The message states that the questions couldn't be loaded, cites a technical error ("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')"), and directs the user to contact the exam team for assistance.

* **Bottom Buttons:** At the very bottom of the screen, two buttons are visible: "Check all" and "Save."


The overall appearance suggests a problem occurred during the loading of the exam, preventing the user from accessing the questions. The error message is detailed, implying a JavaScript error on the platform's backend.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a screenshot of a spreadsheet program, likely Microsoft Excel or a similar application, showing a small data table.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Spreadsheet Structure:** The image displays a portion of a spreadsheet with columns labeled "city," "product," and "sales" in cells A1, B1, and C1 respectively.  The header row is highlighted in a light orange color.  There's a small filter icon (a funnel symbol) in the header row next to each column name.

* **Data:** The table contains five rows of data (rows 2-6), all appearing to relate to sales of bacon in Sao Paulo (with slight spelling variations in the "city" column).  The "sales" column contains numerical values representing sales figures.¬† Row 7 contains the sum of the sales column, 2871.

* **Formatting:** The cells are neatly aligned.  The numbers in the "sales" column are right-aligned, and the text in other columns is left-aligned.  The font appears to be a standard sans-serif font.

* **Overall:** The image is clear and easy to understand.  It depicts a simple data set suitable for analysis or reporting.  The use of filters suggests the possibility of sorting or filtering this data within the spreadsheet.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image contains a document detailing a data analysis task related to website usage.¬†


**Content Overview:**

The document outlines a project analyzing Apache web server logs for a website, s-anand.net, specifically focusing on its "telugu" section. The goal is to determine the number of successful GET requests to this section on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 during May 2024. This data will inform decisions about scaling server resources, content planning, and marketing strategies.

**Key Information:**

* **Data Source:** A 61MB GZipped Apache log file with 258,074 rows.
* **Log File Format:**¬†Non-standard; fields are space-separated, mostly double-quoted (except the "Time" field), with some unique quoting issues affecting 41 rows.
* **Time Zone:** GMT-0500
* **Data Requirements:** Successful GET requests (HTTP status codes 200-299) to URLs under "/telugu/" on Saturdays within the specified time window.
* **Log File Fields:** IP address, remote logname, remote user, time, request (method, URL, protocol), status, size, referer, user agent, vhost, and server.
* **Task:** To count the number of successful GET requests that meet the criteria above.
* **Benefits of Analysis:** The analysis will help optimize infrastructure, improve content delivery, and enhance marketing efforts.

**Visual Aspects:**

The document is text-heavy, presented in a clear, readable font. Bullet points are extensively used to structure the information.  The sections are clearly defined with titles and subheadings. The text is primarily black on a white background.  The image is a high-quality scan or screenshot of the document.

In short, the image shows a detailed technical specification for a data analysis project involving web server logs. The focus is on extracting specific information to optimize website performance and marketing.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for ‚ÄúSaturday‚Äù is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-
Thank you

I‚Äôve attempted this question several times and I‚Äôm fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I‚Äôd be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I‚Äôm certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.
Please consider my request and double check-
@Jivraj, @carlton

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a document outlining a case study titled "Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics."¬†


The document details a scenario where ReceiptRevive Analytics, a data recovery and business intelligence firm, needs to extract sales data from a JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data provided by their client, RetailFlow Inc.¬†


The challenge is that the JSON data is incomplete due to damage to the original paper receipts during digitization. Specifically, the 'id' field (a unique receipt identifier) is missing from many entries.


The task for the data analyst is threefold:

1. **Parse the Sales Data:** Extract the 'sales' values from each row of the JSON data, accurately handling the missing 'id' fields.
2. **Data Validation and Cleanup:** Ensure the data is handled correctly despite the incomplete entries, focusing solely on the 'sales' values.
3. **Calculate Total Sales:** Sum the 'sales' values across all 100 rows to get a single aggregate total.


The document highlights the benefits of successfully completing this task, including reconstructing historical sales data, informing business decisions, enhancing data recovery processes, and building client trust.


Finally, the document provides instructions to download the JSON data from a file named "q-parse-partial-json.jsonl". The overall tone is professional and technical, describing a real-world data analysis problem and its solution. The document is primarily text-based with bullet points and numbered lists to clearly structure the information.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a table, likely from a spreadsheet or database program.¬†


The table has three columns with headers:

* **city:** This column displays the city "London" repeatedly in each row.
* **product:** This column displays the product "Computer" repeatedly in each row.
* **sales:** This column contains a list of numerical values representing sales figures. These numbers vary from row to row (406, 916, 821, 457, 922, 610, 111, 109, 866, 975).

The appearance suggests a simple data table, perhaps part of a larger data set. The style is somewhat plain, with a light gray background and darker gray grid lines.  The header row is slightly darker. The numbers in the "sales" column appear to be in a darker green font color.  There are drop-down arrow icons visible in the header row above each column, suggesting the possibility of filtering or sorting the data.
