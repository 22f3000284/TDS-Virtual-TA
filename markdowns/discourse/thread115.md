### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital image of a simple, yellow smiley face emoji. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's a perfect or nearly perfect circle.
* **Color:** The face is a bright, solid yellow.
* **Eyes:** Two small, dark (almost black) dots are positioned symmetrically near the top of the circle.  They are simple and don't have any pupils or other details.
* **Mouth:** A simple, slightly curved line forms a small, understated smile.  It's not a wide, exaggerated grin but rather a subtle, pleasant expression.
* **Background:** The background is transparent or black, making the yellow of the smiley face stand out.

The overall style is minimalistic and clean, characteristic of emojis used in digital communication.

For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen capture, likely from an online learning platform or coding assignment. 


The top section displays a question number "16" and the title "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)," indicating a coding exercise worth half a mark.


Below that, instructions are given:  The user is to download a zip file named "q-move-rename-files.zip," extract it, and move all files from subfolders into a single empty folder. Then, they must rename each file, incrementing each digit by one (e.g., "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt").


Finally, the core question is posed:  "What does running `grep .*\* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?" This asks what the output of that specific bash command will be when executed in the directory containing the renamed files.  The command uses grep to select all files, sorts them using LC_ALL=C locale, and then calculates the SHA256 checksum of the resulting list.

The overall style is dark; the text is light-colored against a dark background, typical of many code editors or terminal interfaces.

Hi anant,
Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.
In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

@21f2000370 Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a clean, minimalist webpage header for a graded assignment. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Title:** The main heading reads "Tools in Data Science - Graded Assignment 1" in a simple, sans-serif font. The text is centered and uses a clear, professional typeface.

* **Deadline:** Below the title, "Deadline:" is displayed, implying a space for the assignment's due date, though this space is left blank.

* **Note:** A small note is present at the bottom, explaining that each page reload shuffles the quiz questions to prevent cheating by copying answers from previous attempts.  It also assures students that multiple submissions are allowed. The note is in a smaller font size than the title.

* **Overall Style:** The entire webpage fragment is white with black text. The design is simple and uncluttered, focusing on providing clear information about the assignment. There are no images, graphics, or other decorative elements.

As I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer  if I follow correct logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as 209->310

Hi Anant,

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a teal-colored square containing a single, uppercase, white letter "A". 


The "A" is centrally located and is a simple, sans-serif font. The color contrast between the bright white letter and the dark teal background makes the "A" highly visible. The image is clean and devoid of any other elements or distractions.

**Image 2**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a code-related question on a dark-themed interface, likely a learning platform or programming assignment. 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Top Section:** A numbered item (16) indicates the question's position within a larger set. The title "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)" suggests a task involving file manipulation, weighted at half a mark.

* **Instruction Section:**  The instructions detail steps: downloading a zip file ("q-move-rename-files.zip"), extracting its contents, moving all files from subfolders into a single empty folder, and then renaming files by incrementing each digit (e.g., "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt").

* **Question Section:** The core question asks what the output would be when executing a specific bash command sequence within the folder containing the processed files. The command uses: `grep .\* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`. This sequence suggests:  finding all files (`grep .\*`), sorting them using a specific locale (`LC_ALL=C sort`), and then calculating their SHA256 checksums (`sha256sum`).

* **Overall Style:** The interface is dark-themed with light-colored text for better readability. The code snippets and instructions are clearly formatted. The numbered item and mark allocation suggest it's part of a graded assignment or exercise.

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Which HTML content we want to take?

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a code-based question within a dark-themed interface. 


The top part presents the problem:  The user is instructed to find all `<div>` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden HTML element using CSS selectors. The goal is to calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes.


Below that is a text input field labeled "Sum of data-value attributes:" where the user is supposed to enter their answer.  A small, red circle with an "i" inside is visible near the right side of the input box, which possibly indicates a tooltip or help feature.


The overall style is minimalistic and dark, typical of a programming or coding environment. The text is clearly legible against the dark background.  The image only captures a section of the interface; there's no visible HTML code or other surrounding elements.

Hi Hisham,
Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

@s.anand  please guide me through this question, my answer is showing incorrect

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a graded assignment on a website, likely for a web development course. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A browser tab bar is visible at the very top, showing titles such as "Graded Assignment 1," "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Develop," "Latest Courses/Tools in Data," and "Beginner's Guide to the Basics."  The URL in the address bar indicates a development environment.  A bookmarks menu is also partially visible.

* **Assignment Details:** The assignment's due date ("Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST") and current score ("8.75/10") are prominently displayed, along with "Check" and "Save" buttons.

* **Instructional Content:** The main part of the screen shows instructions for the assignment, which focuses on CSS selectors.  The instructions explain different types of CSS selectors (basic, attribute, combinators) and provide links to resources like the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and a game ("CSS Diner") for practice.

* **Assignment Question:** The core assignment involves finding all `<div>` elements with a "foo" class within a hidden HTML element and calculating the sum of their `data-value` attributes.  The student's answer (482) is incorrect.

* **Side Panel:** A sidebar displays a list of files, many of which are marked as "Removed."

* **Bottom Section:** The bottom shows a preview of another assignment question about processing files with different encodings.

The overall design is dark-themed, with light text on a dark background. The screen captures what appears to be an online learning platform or testing environment.

Hi manmeet,
I don’t know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.
