Hello Sir, @s.anand @carlton
As TDS is one of the most important courses in the data science diploma, I respectfully want to bring up a concern. The TDS roe exam is almost impossible to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a statement by your side‚Ä¶
My question is, why is this exam graded and carrying  20% weightage towards the final grade? Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this exam ungraded or reduce its weightage. This is a very serious issue, as many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.
Thank you for your consideration.

I completely understand and share the concerns about the time constraints of the TDS exam. Given the challenging nature of the test, it seems quite difficult to complete all the questions within the allotted 45 minutes.
I believe even the course team would find it challenging to solve this exam in such a short time frame.

Perhaps considering a percentile-based grading system could be a fairer approach, as it would better reflect the relative performance of all students.

This way, we can ensure that the grading is equitable and does not unfairly impact our CGPAs. I hope the team can consider this suggestion.

@23ds1000034 @nandanreddyp
TDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly penalises you.

This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly.

While that seems like a nice sound bite, let‚Äôs look at the data as true data scientists rather than let emotion lead our thoughts.
If you get an S in TDS, its weight to your total Diploma CGPA will be 5.55%.
When you consider that ROE is worth 20% of that, the overall effect on your diploma CGPA at BEST is 1.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect is lower if you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!

This is a very serious issue

A little over dramatic a statement considering the data we now have considered above. The  reality is the ROE is worth 0.83% of your overall diploma CGPA (and that too this is the worst case, i.e. for direct diploma students! For those that started from foundation its impact is even smaller! 0.52%)
What is my opinion on ROE? It made me a better student. I was truly humbled by the experience. It gave me a realistic view of my abilities and the level I need to attain so that I can be confident in the value I am adding to the client. Who is the client? The businesses I might deal with, the companies I contract for.
If there was no value attached to the ROE (i.e. you have no stake in it) then all the evidence points to one very simple truth. Nearly no one taking it seriously.

many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

My mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree. If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant for you.
ROE is not harsh. ROE is like my mother‚Äôs very wise advice. There are many, many examples of students dropping out of university and being successful in life. Do not waste your time, its more valuable than anything you possess. If you are struggling, to even maintain a 6 CGPA requirement to enter the degree level because of an ROE that contributes > 0.834%, then the very best advice you will ever receive from me is: Do not waste your time with this degree.
I say this with all sincerity and truth. I am living evidence, as are many others, you do not need this degree to succeed in life. The reason I am doing this degree is because I realised that I actually enjoy this course and I find real value from it and hope to make a difference for good with what I learn from it.
Although it is called the impossible exam, our data shows that there are several students that have done well in the ROE. ROE is not harsh. It‚Äôs a reality check, its a mother‚Äôs advice and a very inexpensive, truthful and effective one.
Humbly for your kind consideration

Carlton at his best again !!! @carlton my apologies for being dramatic but I have been a TA for one of the foundational level courses and after that I gave up on being TA despite of having good grades in some subjects , to be honest at this point of time I envy you ‚Ä¶ You are nailing it as a TA ‚Ä¶one of the best TAs I have seen in this course.

**Image 1**: That's an emoji depicting two hands clapping together.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Hands:** Two yellow, cartoonish hands are shown in the process of clapping.¬†They are simplified representations, not realistic depictions of hands. Each hand has four fingers and a thumb.

* **Clapping Action:** The hands are positioned as if in mid-clap, slightly overlapping.

* **Sparkle Effect:** Small, light gray, stylized sparkles or bursts of energy are shown around the hands, suggesting the sound and movement of the clapping. These are simple, angular shapes.

* **Background:** The background is black, providing a stark contrast to the yellow of the hands.

* **Style:** The overall style is simple, clean, and typical of modern emoji design.  The lines are bold, and the colors are flat and untextured.

**Image 2**: That's an emoji depicting two hands clapping together.¬†

Since ROE is done and whatever everyone has scored cannot be changed. Well, we can make up for the marks that we lost by having few more extra activities, if that‚Äôs possible @s.anand sir. That way we get back what we lost, improve CGPA (irrespective of whatever CGPA one has) and learn in the process that would be a win-win situation for everyone.
Thanks & Regards,

@carlton, we are mixing something straightforward as the ability to score an S or A grade in TDS with a philosophical outlook on the topic.
The philosophy is helpful if the grades for most students are following a standard bell curve (average of all subjects or average of TDS over the last few semensters) and a few students are outliers in terms of the grading. For e.g., if I score a lower than expected grade and I am feeling demotivated, I can understand what you just wrote and it is indeed very much to the point.
However, if the entire grading bell curve has shifted and most students are not scoring grades as per expectation, it is time for the instructors to consider whether the grading pattern needs to be tweaked (20% for an ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ROE is perhaps on the higher side) or students need to be provided with alternate paths to a decent grade (like extra assignments for 10-20 marks in lieu of the loss of marks above mentioned ROE).
I would like to reiterate that my observations above are only w.r.t. a standard grading bell curve for all subjects or for TDS from previous terms.
Do note that all IITs follow normalization of marks and grades as a standard activity so that students can focus on learning and giving it their best rather than worrying about grades. This is not the case in this course, so we should think about alternative grading patterns without compromising on the rigour of the course in any way.

You can become a TA while doing the degree?? Never knew that, can you please lay out the process? It would be a fun and enriching experience for me.

iitmanupam:

a philosophical outlook on the topic


There‚Äôs a lot of philosophy in there but that‚Äôs what makes it so entertaining to read his writing 



 iitmanupam:

if the entire grading bell curve has shifted


Disagree with this if you mean the bell curve has shifted between terms. RoE has been really tough since the past 3 terms at least (I haven‚Äôt checked with students who did it before that, so I don‚Äôt know about those). Or if the issue is a bell curve mismatch between different subjects, we shouldn‚Äôt be expecting that to be perfect. Some of the subjects were extremely easy, but nobody complained about those 
For what it‚Äôs worth, I also felt it was tough beyond reason. These sort of exams where the time required far exceeds the time given is more typical of competitive exams where the score isn‚Äôt important, only your rank is. All that being said, I still didn‚Äôt complain since the difficulty is ‚Äúreal‚Äù, and not made-up like with BDM theory/project. With the first, the difficulty comes from an extremely poor grading system, and with the second, from having to find a business that will share data. The subjects themselves don‚Äôt pose a significant intellectual challenge.
Also, is an S at TDS really hard this term? I scored one last term despite a poor RoE performance. I‚Äôm unable to recall now whether they gave us some extra marks out of pity 
PS: There is no implication from any of my remarks that I will stop sharing RoE jokes/memes

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.¬†


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with brown eyes and skin. He has a shaved or very closely cropped head, revealing a light scalp. His expression is neutral or slightly pleasant, and he has a soft jawline.

* **Clothing:** He's wearing a dark gray or charcoal-colored collared shirt.¬†

* **Image Quality:** The image is a standard passport-style photograph. The quality is somewhat low-resolution; the details are slightly blurry, particularly in the background, which is a plain, light color. The image appears to be a scan or digital reproduction of a printed photograph.

The overall impression is a formal, straightforward portrait.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up shot of a stylized smiling emoticon.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Emoticon:** The main focus is a large, round yellow emoticon with a wide, open-mouthed smile. The eyes are simple, dark ovals. The smile is prominent, showcasing a wide, slightly upturned mouth with a pink tongue visible. The overall style is cheerful and cartoonish.

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, slightly darker shade of orange or yellowish-orange, providing a contrasting yet complementary backdrop to the yellow emoticon.  The color transition between the emoticon and the background isn't sharply defined, suggesting a soft blend.

* **Image Quality:** The image appears to be a digital rendering, possibly a version of a standard emoji or a similar graphic.  The resolution isn't exceptionally high, but the details are clear enough to readily identify the emoticon.

In short, it's a simple yet effective image conveying happiness and positivity through a classic smiley face design.

**Image 3**: That's a close-up headshot of a man.¬†


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **Appearance:** The man appears to be of South Asian descent, with brown skin and dark eyes. His head is shaved or very closely cropped. He has a somewhat round face and a neutral or slightly pleasant expression.

* **Attire:** He's wearing a dark gray or charcoal-colored collared shirt.¬†The shirt appears to be a relatively simple, possibly button-down style.

* **Image Quality:** The photo is a passport-style or similar formal headshot. The quality is not exceptionally high; it's somewhat grainy or pixelated, particularly noticeable in the skin tones and background. The background is plain and light-colored, almost white.

* **Lighting:** The lighting appears even and somewhat flat, typical of a photograph taken in a controlled setting. There are no strong shadows.


The overall impression is that of a fairly standard, somewhat low-resolution passport-style photograph of a man.

**Image 4**: That's a close-up shot of a stylized, cartoonish emoticon or emoji depicting a smiling face.¬†


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** The face is a bright, almost saturated yellow circle, set against a slightly less saturated orange background that's visible on the sides. The orange background suggests a frame or border.

* **Facial Features:** The features are simple but expressive:
    * **Eyes:** Two dark, oval-shaped eyes are positioned slightly above the center.
    * **Mouth:** A wide, open mouth with a large, slightly upward-curving line indicating a big smile. The mouth shows a pink tongue.

* **Style:** The style is reminiscent of modern emojis or emoticons; very simple, clean lines and bright, bold colors. The overall feel is cheerful and friendly.

The image is high-resolution enough to see the details of the shading and the slight texture to the face's color.  The lack of sharp edges contributes to the soft, cartoonish quality.

**Image 5**: That's a close-up image of a smiling emoticon, specifically a variation of the classic yellow smiley face.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Face:** The emoticon is a bright, sunny yellow circle. The eyes are simple, dark circles, and the mouth is a wide, open smile with a slightly raised, pink tongue showing. The smile is very expressive and conveys happiness or joy.

* **The Background:** The background is a slightly darker, orangish-yellow, providing a subtle contrast to the brighter yellow of the emoticon.  A portion of the background is cut off, suggesting the image is cropped.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish, typical of emojis and emoticons used in digital communication. The features are not highly detailed; they are smooth and rounded.

In short, it's a cheerful and easily recognizable happy face emoticon.

**Image 6**: That's a close-up shot of a winking emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Emoji:** The main focus is a yellow circle representing the face of the emoji.¬†It's a classic winking smiley face.

* **Features:** The emoji has a wide, upward-curving smile. One eye is closed in a wink, depicted with a slightly curved line. The other eye is a simple, small black dot.  The eyebrows are simple short curved lines.

* **Color:** The emoji is bright yellow, with the features in black.  There's also a hint of an orange background partially visible at the edges, suggesting it might be cropped from a larger image or screen.

* **Style:** The style is consistent with common depictions of emojis across various platforms, rather than a unique or stylized version.


The image is simple and clearly depicts a winking emoji.

Come on. I didn‚Äôt complain. I just gave my observations. In fact, the only time I really complained in this course was when I was suddenly left hanging because the ROE stopped 15 minutes before the time shown in the portal. That was then. After seeing the difficulty level of the repeat ROE from yesterday, I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones who was able to attempt the ROE last Sunday, regardless of the mess up from the support team.
I‚Äôve also said many times on Discourse that I think this is one of the best courses at IITM and nothing about it should be changed. I don‚Äôt know how you got an S in spite of a poor ROE. For me, I will have to score a perfect 100% in the ET to get an S, so I was just being realisitic when I requested for additional assignments to give students a fighting chance to score an S.

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up shot of a man.¬†


Here's a description based on what's visible:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with brown skin and dark hair that is short and neatly styled. His expression is neutral, perhaps slightly serious. He's looking directly at the camera.

* **His Attire:** He's wearing a light blue, collared, button-down shirt. The fabric looks relatively smooth.

* **The Background:** The background is entirely out of focus but clearly shows a dark, textured surface. It appears to be some kind of sound-dampening material, possibly acoustic foam panels commonly used in recording studios or similar environments, with a diamond or hexagonal pattern. The dark color contrasts sharply with the man's light-colored shirt.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is fairly good, though not exceptionally sharp.¬†It seems to be a photograph, not a drawing or illustration. The focus is primarily on the man's face and upper body.

Overall, the image presents a fairly simple, straightforward portrait of a man against a dark, textured background.

Sorry, didn‚Äôt mean to say that you‚Äôre complaining. Meant literally that I didn‚Äôt complain despite the unusual difficulty level though this sort of thing is usually a cause for concern.
Maybe we got some extra marks last term then, I‚Äôm not sure. (A student with better memory than me can chime in)

@Saransh_Saini They will contact you before the start of term if you done well in a subject.
@Arun2 I think last term they gave an extra 5 mark bonus for the Roe mishap ?

* **The Background:** The background is a dark, textured surface. It appears to be some kind of acoustic paneling, common in recording studios or other sound-dampening environments. The texture is made up of small, diamond-shaped or possibly hexagonal patterns.  The darkness of the background contrasts sharply with the man's lighter shirt.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is decent, but not exceptionally sharp. It's likely a photograph, not a drawing or illustration.  The resolution is not high enough to see fine details like individual shirt threads or facial pores.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up shot of a winking emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Emoji:** The main focus is a yellow circle representing the face of a winking emoticon.  It has a wide, simple smile, and one eye is closed in a wink while the other is open and clearly depicted. The style is consistent with common emoji designs found in digital communication.

* **Color:** The emoji is predominantly bright yellow, with darker yellow/brown outlines for the features (eyes, mouth). The background is a slightly less saturated orange color, possibly a partial display of the surrounding area where the emoji is placed.

* **Style:** The emoji is simple, round, and cartoonish, characteristic of many widely used emoji sets.  There's no significant shading or texture.

* **Quality:** The image appears to be a digital representation of an emoji, possibly a screenshot or a cropped portion from a larger image or application. The resolution is moderate; the details aren't extremely sharp, but the emoji is easily recognizable.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low resolution; the man's features appear slightly blurred or pixelated, especially his hair and the shirt's texture.¬†It's likely a scanned image.


The overall impression is that this is a standard, formal portrait, likely taken for official purposes.
