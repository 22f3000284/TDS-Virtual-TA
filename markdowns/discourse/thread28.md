### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a digital image of a simple smiley-face emoticon. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape:** A perfectly round, yellow circle.
* **Features:** Two small, dark-colored dots represent eyes, positioned somewhat centrally and horizontally aligned. A simple, slightly curved line forms the mouth, suggesting a contented or slightly amused expression.  The mouth is positioned below the eyes, in the lower portion of the circle.
* **Style:** The style is minimalistic and cartoonish, typical of emoticons used in digital communication. The edges are slightly pixelated, suggesting a low-resolution image or a digital rendering style.
* **Color:** The predominant color is a bright, sunny yellow. The eyes are a dark color, likely black or brown.

The overall impression is one of simple, cheerful positivity.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a code editor or similar interface, displaying a question and a subsequent error message. 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Top Section:** The top line asks, "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/". This suggests the user is trying to determine the correct URL for a GitHub Pages site.

* **Blank Input Field:** Below the question is a long, empty text input field, seemingly where the user was expected to enter their answer. A small red circle with an exclamation point inside indicates an error.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field is an error message, which reads "Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response:". This indicates that the system encountered an error while attempting to access or process a response, likely related to the URL the user was trying to construct or verify.  Following this, there is a snippet of HTML code, suggesting the error might be related to the server's response not containing expected HTML elements or data.

The overall appearance suggests a debugging or troubleshooting session within a web development or deployment context. The color scheme is dark, common in many coding environments.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed code editor or terminal window. 


The top line displays the question: "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api".  This acts as a prompt or instruction.


Below it, a text input field is partially visible. The partially visible text inside reads "https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api".  This appears to be the user's answer to the prompt.


At the very bottom, an error message is displayed: "TypeError: Failed to fetch".  This suggests that there was a problem retrieving data or executing code related to the provided Vercel URL.

The overall aesthetic is consistent with a development environment, with dark background and light text colors.

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.
Try adding CORS to your code it might work.
Kind regards

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. 


Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **Repository Name:** The main title shows "gkfrombs/dolfacts". This indicates the username ("gkfrombs") and the repository name ("dolfacts").

* **Repository Icon:** A small, square icon to the right likely represents the type of project (possibly a game or software based on the pixelated design).

* **Repository Statistics:** Below the main title, there's a row of statistics:
    * **Contributors:** Shows "1" indicating one contributor to the repository.
    * **Issues:** Shows "0", meaning no open issues.
    * **Stars:** Shows "0", indicating no users have starred the repository.
    * **Forks:** Shows "0", signifying no forks of the repository.

* **GitHub Logo:** A small, stylized GitHub cat logo is in the bottom right corner.

* **Background:** The background is primarily white with a horizontal orange bar at the very bottom.

The overall impression is that this is a relatively new or inactive GitHub repository with minimal activity.

@carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a macOS screen displaying several windows related to software development. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Code Editor (Main Focus):** The central window is a code editor showing Python code using the FastAPI framework. The code appears to be a simple API endpoint that reads student data from a CSV file and allows filtering by class.  The code includes comments explaining the purpose of different sections, such as enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to handle requests from different domains.

* **Terminal Window:** A terminal window shows the output of a `uvicorn` command, indicating that a web server (Uvicorn) has started and is listening on a specific port (8000) on the local machine (127.0.0.1). It also displays various HTTP requests being handled by the server.

* **Web Browser Window (Partial View):** A partially visible web browser window shows a simple web page likely testing the API. The text "API application using Uvicorn" is visible, along with buttons suggesting file uploads ("Image Upload").

* **Dock:** At the bottom of the screen, the macOS dock is visible, showing various application icons including Safari, Mail, a music app, and other developer tools (like VS Code).

* **Overall:** The image gives the impression of a developer testing a FastAPI application. The code is well-commented, and the terminal output shows successful server startup and request handling. The browser window hints at a simple front-end application interacting with the API. The overall aesthetic is consistent with a standard macOS environment.

Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok
image1920×886 45.7 KB
I tired multiple times but issue is still there.
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a detailed error message from the ngrok service, a tool used to expose local servers to the internet. 


Here's a breakdown of the visual elements:

* **Top Section:** A diagram shows the flow of traffic: Internet -> ngrok Edge -> ngrok Agent -> Your Service. The "ngrok Agent" section has a red "X", indicating an error.

* **Error Message Box:** A prominent red-bordered box displays the error code "ERR_NGROK_8012" and explains that the ngrok agent successfully received traffic but couldn't connect to the local web service running at `http://localhost:8080`. The specific error is a "connection refused" error from the operating system level. A text box contains diagnostic information, showing the attempt to connect to port 8080 on the local machine (127.0.0.1). There is a link to get further help.

* **Developer Instructions:** A section titled "If you're the developer of this page" advises developers to ensure a web service is running on the specified local port (`localhost:8080`). It suggests using cURL or a browser to test the local service. A link to ngrok documentation is provided.

* **Visitor Instructions:** A section titled "If you're a visitor of this page" advises visitors to wait and refresh the page, or to contact the page's developer if the problem persists.


The overall style is clean and uses clear language to communicate the nature and potential solutions to the error. The color scheme is primarily light gray and white, with accents of red to highlight the error.

Hi Mishkat,
Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.
eg
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.
Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,
This error is because you are filtering on class_ instead of class
So if you send a request on http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S you will see response for that 1S class only.
kind regards

Hi Guddu,
Inside index.html file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.
This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.
kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB
I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).
wsl --version
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a screenshot of a Docker Desktop error message. 


Here's a breakdown of what the image shows:

* **Error Title:** At the top, it clearly states: "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error". This indicates a problem with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) integration within Docker Desktop.

* **Error Description:** Below the title, the message explains that an unexpected error occurred during the execution of a WSL command.

* **Suggested Solutions:** The message offers two primary troubleshooting steps:
    * Shut down WSL using the command `wsl --shutdown` and then reboot the machine.
    * Reinstall both WSL and Docker Desktop.

* **Further Troubleshooting:** If the problem persists, the user is advised to collect diagnostic data and submit an issue report. There are hyperlinks for both of these actions.

* **Detailed Error Log:** A section shows a more technical error message from the process: "deploying WSL2 distributions ensuring main distro is deployed: deploying "docker-desktop": importing WSL distro "WSL2 is not supported with". This points to an incompatibility between the Docker Desktop installation and the WSL2 version.

* **Buttons:** At the bottom, there are two buttons:
    * "Gather diagnostics": This button allows the user to collect diagnostic information, which can be helpful in diagnosing and reporting the problem.
    * "Quit": This button closes the error dialog.

* **Overall Appearance:** The dialog box has a dark theme, typical of many applications. The text is easily readable against the dark background.


In short, the image shows a common issue encountered when using Docker Desktop on Windows, and it provides guidance on how to troubleshoot and resolve the problem.

Hi Telvin,
Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.
I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.

@22f2001640 in that case

a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.
