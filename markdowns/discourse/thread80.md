### 🖼 Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture, likely from an online learning platform, displaying information about a "Tools in Data Science" course. 


Here's a breakdown of the visual elements:

* **Header:** The top section features a dark maroon background with a pattern of small, evenly spaced dots. The text "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed in a large, sans-serif font in white. Below this, "NEW COURSE" is written in a smaller, but still bold, white font.

* **Body:** Below the header, a light gray section contains a list of assignments and scores for a course. Each line indicates the week number, the assignment type ("Assignment"), and the score received (e.g., "Week 1 Assignment - 80.00"). The scores are given as numbers with two decimal places. Notably, the "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" shows "Absent."

The overall style is clean and organized, typical of educational online platforms. The color contrast between the dark header and the light body makes the information easy to read.

Dear Sir,
I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.
I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a webpage or application interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Section:** The top section shows a simple login message stating "You are logged in as 23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." Below this is a button labeled "Logout".

Hi @carlton @Jivraj sir,
I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”
I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?
Thank you
