Hello everyone,
I have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with actual questions from the GA’s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of ‘test cases’ so that we can try and fix our project?
Thank you very much in advance
Aryan Singh

You can do a curl post request or use something like Thunderclient or Postman. If you used fastapi then in the /docs path of your link you will find the open API user interface which you can also use for testing.
