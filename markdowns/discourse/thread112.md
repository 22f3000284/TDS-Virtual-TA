### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a close-up image of stylized anime-style artwork featuring what appears to be a character reminiscent of Monkey D. Luffy from the anime series *One Piece*.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Character:** The character is depicted from the chest up. They have brown hair peeking out from under a yellow straw hat similar to Luffy's iconic hat.¬†Their expression seems to be one of either joy or slight distress, with eyes partially closed and a hand raised in a gesture that could be interpreted as a wave or a cheer. The character's features are somewhat simplified, in line with anime aesthetic.

* **Style:** The art style is soft and slightly simplistic, with not overly detailed lines or shading.¬†The color palette is muted, with a peach or light orange background and the yellow of the hat being the most prominent color.

* **Composition:** The character is positioned centrally but slightly lower in the frame, leaving significant empty space above. This empty space contributes to the overall simplicity and minimalist feel of the image.

* **Overall:** The image is likely a fan art piece or a still from a similar style of animation. It evokes a sense of lightness and playfulness due to the character's pose and the soft color scheme.

**Image 2**: That's a close-up shot of a digital image depicting an exclamation point (!) and a question mark (?) side-by-side.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Characters:** The exclamation point and question mark are the central focus. They appear three-dimensional, with a slightly rounded, glossy look suggesting a texture like plastic or enamel.

* **Color:** Both characters are a vibrant, slightly reddish-orange.¬†The color is consistent across both symbols.

* **Style:** The font style is simple and bold, reminiscent of a pixelated or low-resolution graphic. The edges aren't perfectly smooth; there's a slightly blocky quality to them.

* **Background:** The background is entirely black, providing a stark contrast to the red characters and making them stand out prominently.

* **Dots:** Below each symbol, there is a small, round, red dot, mirroring the color and texture of the exclamation mark and question mark.  These dots are smaller than the characters themselves.

The overall impression is one of a simple yet eye-catching graphic, possibly used to represent uncertainty or a surprising question. The pixelated style hints at a retro or digital aesthetic.

**Image 3**: That's a digital image of the popular "thinking emoji" meme.¬†


Here's a description:

* **The Emoji:** It's a stylized yellow circle representing a face, reminiscent of a simplified emoticon.  The face has two dark, slightly oval eyes, a downward-curving mouth suggesting contemplation or concern, and a single eyebrow slightly raised on the left side (from the viewer's perspective).

* **The Hand:** A small, simplified yellow hand is shown at the lower-left, with the index finger touching the cheek in a gesture commonly associated with thoughtfulness.¬†The hand is proportionally smaller than the face.

* **Color and Style:** The overall color palette is dominated by a bright, warm yellow-orange for the face and hand.¬†The lines are relatively simple and smooth, lacking sharp details. The style is intentionally cartoonish and friendly, yet conveying the pensive mood through the expression.

* **Background:** The background is a slightly darker, more saturated orange than the face, providing subtle contrast and making the emoji pop out.

The image's overall effect is straightforward and immediately recognizable as the "thinking emoji," communicating a sense of contemplation or uncertainty.

**Image 4**: That's a close-up shot of a stylized emoticon or emoji.¬†


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Overall Shape and Color:** The main body is a bright, slightly oblong yellow shape, resembling a simplified face. The yellow has a gradient effect, appearing brighter in the center and slightly darker towards the edges, giving it a bit of dimension.

* **Face Features:**¬†The emoticon has large, round, dark eyes, positioned relatively close together.  It boasts a wide, open smile with a distinct, slightly pinkish lower lip.¬†The smile takes up a significant portion of the lower half of the face.

* **Glasses:** The most distinctive feature is a pair of dark, thick-rimmed glasses that sit squarely on the face. The glasses are simple, without much detail in the frame itself.

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and friendly, giving off a cheerful and perhaps slightly nerdy vibe due to the inclusion of the glasses.  The features are simplified and exaggerated for visual impact.

* **Background:** The background is mostly black, but a bit of the yellow from the emoticon bleeds into the top edge, suggesting either cropping or a design choice.

In short, it's a cheerful, simple emoji design with glasses that communicates a sense of happiness and intelligence.

**Image 5**: That's a stylized emoticon or emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** The main body is a rounded, slightly oblong yellow shape, reminiscent of a simplified face. The yellow is bright and saturated, suggesting cheerfulness.

* **Facial Features:** It has large, round, dark eyes that are simple black dots.¬† A wide, open, black mouth curves upwards into a broad, happy smile.¬†A pink tongue is visible under the top lip.

* **Glasses:** The most distinctive feature is a pair of black, nerdy-style glasses resting on the yellow face. The glasses are simple, with thick black frames and no visible lens details.

* **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a feeling of happy intelligence or cleverness, due to the glasses and the broad smile. The style is cartoonish and friendly.  The image is likely digitally created, and the lines are relatively smooth.

**Image 6**: That's a close-up shot of a stylized emoticon or emoji.¬†


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** The main body is a rounded rectangle, slightly wider at the top, reminiscent of a simplified face. The color is a bright, sunny yellow-orange.

* **Facial Features:** The emoji has large, simple oval eyes, dark brown or black, and a wide, open mouth showing a bright pink tongue and white teeth in a cheerful grin. The expression is one of pure happiness or excitement.

* **Glasses:** The most distinctive feature is a pair of dark, thick-rimmed glasses that sit squarely on the emoji's face.¬†The glasses are black and have a classic, slightly nerdy look.

* **Overall Style:** The style is playful and cartoonish, with a simple, flat design.  The lines are bold and smooth, lacking much detail beyond the basic features. The image appears digitally created.

The image is brightly lit and lacks any background details, focusing entirely on the emoji itself.

is it possible to have written solutions to all 5 assignments , instead of just live sessions. I have certain pending questions from the first 5 assignements.

Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a lot of doubts and questions in our minds.

Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our api with the correct answers.

@carlton sir, is there any bonus marks for code uniqueness and extra tasks like project 1

If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?
If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,
I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.
Thanks and Regards
Shalini

### üñº Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-grey or black background with light-grey text.¬†


The top section displays the bold header: **"Deploy your application"**.¬†


Below that, a thin, light-grey horizontal line separates the header from the main text.


The main text body explains the task:¬†"Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel."  This indicates an instruction on how to deploy an application publicly, specifically mentioning Vercel as one option among many possible platforms.

The overall style is simple, clean, and consistent with online documentation or instructions.

If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results

Any question from first 5 Ga‚Äôs can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.

Hi @24f2006531
You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)
Kind regards

Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?

Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project.

my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on?

I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required
