### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Close-up view of a digital graphic announcing "Week 4 Session 4".Â 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Background:** The main background is a light peach or beige color.

* **Central Element:** A dark teal/navy blue banner spans the horizontal middle of the image, prominently displaying "WEEK 4" above "SESSION 4" in a clean, sans-serif font. The text is white.

* **Decorative Elements:**Â Surrounding the banner are various colorful, stylized icons and diagrams related to data, technology, and design. These include charts, graphs, gears, pencils, mobile devices, and network diagrams.  The style is flat and somewhat retro-modern.Â The icons are primarily in shades of teal, orange, yellow, and red. They are neatly arranged, but in a slightly chaotic and playful manner.

* **Overall Style:** The overall style is clean and modern, with a hint of a vintage or mid-century modern feel due to the color palette and iconography. The design is visually engaging, using color and shape to draw attention to the text.


The image appears to be a digital announcement or a promotional graphic for an online course, webinar, or similar event.
