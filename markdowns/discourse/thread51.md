### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a student's online learning platform or gradebook.Â 


The layout is clean and uses a light gray and white color scheme.Â The content is organized into modules, each indicated by a title like "Module 1: Development Tools," "Module 2: Deployment Tools," and so on.Â 


Each module is expandable, with an arrow indicating that more information is hidden beneath.Â Module 2, "Deployment Tools," is expanded to reveal details about an assignment: a graded assignment with a due date (February 2nd, 2025) marked as "Not Submitted."  There's also a table showing placeholders for "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score".Â The other modules are collapsed, showing only their titles.Â 


The overall impression is that of a structured, organized online learning management system displaying a student's progress in a course. The platform appears modern and user-friendly.
