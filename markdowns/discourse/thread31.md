Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited 
Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course
I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

### ðŸ–¼ Image Descriptions

**Image 1**: That's a playful image!Â 


It's a close-up shot of a modified emoji.Â The base is a classic yellow smiley face emoji, with simple black dots for eyes and a wide, open-mouthed smile.Â However, the emoji has been altered to include a long, pink tongue that extends far below the bottom of the face, almost like it's playfully sticking out and down. The background is a solid, slightly muted orange color, providing a contrasting backdrop to the bright yellow of the face and pink of the tongue. The overall style is cartoonish and lighthearted.

**Image 2**: That's a digital image of a simple smiley-face emoticon.Â 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a perfect or near-perfect circle, predominantly a bright, slightly orangish yellow.

* **Features:** The face features two small, dark, circular pupils, positioned slightly below the vertical midline.  A simple, slightly curved line forms the mouth, suggesting a neutral to slightly happy expression. There are no other details like eyebrows or blush.

* **Style:** The style is minimalist and resembles a basic emoticon or emoji, rather than a more detailed cartoon drawing.  The edges are somewhat pixelated or blocky, suggesting a low-resolution image.

* **Background:** The background is entirely black, providing a clear contrast to the yellow smiley face.

**Image 3**: Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code or a similar IDE, with a split view.Â 


**Left Pane:** This pane shows a ChatGPT interaction.Â The top section displays a prompt requesting a solution refinement. Below that, there's an "Edited" section, detailing code updates to handle environments without SSL using `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable. A `ModuleNotFoundError` related to the `ssl` module is also visible, indicating a problem that has been addressed.Â Finally, a concluding statement asks the user to report further issues.


**Right Pane:** This pane displays Python code within the code editor. The code appears to fetch a Wikipedia page for a given country, parse the HTML using Beautiful Soup, and extract headings (H1 to H6) to generate a Markdown outline.Â The code includes error handling for HTTP requests. Below the main code block, a "Console" section shows a successful execution message ("Run successfully") and a series of import errors, tracing back through various Python packages like `starlette` and `anyio`, ultimately pointing to a missing `ssl` module -Â the same issue resolved in the left pane's ChatGPT interaction.


**Overall:** The image highlights a common programming scenario: troubleshooting a code error (missing `ssl` module) using a combination of error messages, code debugging, and an AI assistant (ChatGPT) to guide the resolution. The split-screen view effectively presents both the problem and the debugging process.Â The presence of a user's profile picture in the top right corner suggests a user interface element of the code editor.
