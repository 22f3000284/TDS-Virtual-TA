* **Top:** Shows the IIT Madras logo and the course title "Sep 2024 - TDS".

    * **Top Announcement:** "[TDS Sep 2024] Project 2 released" with a date of December 2nd.  This is linked to a GitHub repository.  A description detailing the project's challenge (writing an LLM-based program and convincing the LLM of the code's correctness) is provided, urging students to start early.  A Discourse thread link is included for questions.

    * **Middle Announcement:** "[TDS Sep 2024] Project 2 Updates" on December 12th.
